Involvement of different transduction pathways in NF-kappa B activation by several inducers.
Double-stimulation was used to demonstrate that, in a T lymphocytic cell line (CEM), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) rapidly induced NF-kappa B through a signaling pathway which did not involve reactive oxygen species (ROS) and was different from the activation triggered by either H2O2 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).
Since these latter compounds were known to activate NF-kappa B translocation in a redox-sensitive way, we have demonstrated that NF-kappa B activation by PMA was resistant to antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and sensitive to kinase inhibitors staurosporine and H7 while activation by H2O2 or TNF-alpha were not.
