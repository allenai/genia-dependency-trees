Switching gears during T-cell maturation: RANTES and late transcription.
Although much is understood about the induction of genes expressed early (within 24 h) after T-cell activation, little is known about the regulation of expression of genes expressed 'late' (three or more days) post-stimulation.
A better understanding of transcriptional regulation at this important stage of T-cell maturation may yield new insights into T-cell development and new immunotherapeutic targets.
