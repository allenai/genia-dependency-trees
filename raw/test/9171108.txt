The class II trans-activator CIITA interacts with the TBP-associated factor TAFII32.
The class II trans- activator (CIITA) is the main transcriptional co-activator for the expression of MHC class II proteins.
Its N-terminal 125 amino acids function as an independent transcriptional activation domain.
Analyses of the primary amino acid sequence of the activation domain predict the presence of three alpha-helices, each with a high proportion of acidic residues.
Using site-directed mutagenesis, we found that two of these predicted alpha-helices are required for full transcriptional activation by CIITA.
Moreover, a CIITA protein in which both functional alpha-helices have been deleted displays a dominant negative phenotype.
This activation domain of CIITA interacts with the 32 kDa subunit of the general transcription complex TFIID, TAFII32.
Decreased transcriptional activation by N-terminal deletions of CIITA is correlated directly with their reduced binding to TAFII32.
We conclude that interactions between TAFII32 and CIITA are responsible for activation of class II genes.
