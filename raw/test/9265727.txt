Transcription factors in immune-mediated disease.
A large amount of detailed information about the intracellular proteins regulating NF-kappa B activation and the cellular response to NF-kappa B activation has emerged recently.
Several small molecules, an antisense oligonucleotide, and gene therapeutic agents that inhibit NF-kappa b activation have been described.
Despite this, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of this process and its consequences.
In contrast, the characterization of transcription factors selectively regulating cytokine production by CD4+ T cell subsets is at a very early stage.
Three interacting proteins have recently been shown to contribute to subset-restricted expression of the IL-4 gene.
There are other elements regulating IL-4 gene expression, however, and the relative importance of these recently identified proteins has yet to be determined.
