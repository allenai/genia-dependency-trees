Analysis of myeloid-associated genes in human hematopoietic progenitor cells.
The distribution of myeloid lineage-associated cytokine receptors and lysosomal proteins was analyzed in human CD34+ cord blood cell (CB) subsets at different stages of myeloid commitment by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
The highly specific granulomonocyte-associated lysosomal proteins myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lysozyme (LZ), as well as the transcription factor PU.1, were already detectable in the most immature CD34+Thy-1+ subset.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor, granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF receptor alpha subunit and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors I (p55) and II (p75) were also detected in this subset in addition to c-kit and flt-3, receptors known to be expressed on progenitor cells.
By contrast, the monocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor was largely absent at this stage and in the CD34+Thy-1-CD45RA- subsets.
The M-CSF receptor was first detectable in the myeloid-committed CD34+Thy-l-CD45RA+ subset.
All other molecules studied were found to be expressed at this stage of differentiation.
Different cocktails of the identified ligands were added to sorted CD34+Thy-1+ single cells.
Low proliferative capacity was observed after 1 week in culture in the presence of stem cell factor (SCF) + Flt-3 ligand (FL) + G-CSF.
Addition of GM-CSF to this basic cocktail consistently increased the clonogenic capacity of single CD34+Thy-1+ cells, and this effect was further enhanced (up to 72.3 +/- 4.3% on day 7) by the inclusion of TNF-alpha.
In conclusion, the presence of myeloid-associated growth factor receptor transcripts in CD34+ CB subsets does not discriminate the various stages of differentiation, with the exception of the M-CSF receptor.
In addition, we show that TNF-alpha is a potent costimulatory factor of the very immature CD34+Thy-1+ CB subset.
