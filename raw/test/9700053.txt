Human 15-lipoxygenase gene promoter: analysis and identification of DNA binding sites for IL-13-induced regulatory factors in monocytes.
In order to study the transcriptional control of 15-LO expression, we have cloned and sequenced the human 15-LO promoter region.
The 15-LO promoter is associated with a CpG island at the 5'-end of the gene, and sequence analysis reveals putative Sp1 and Ap2 binding site/s and absence of TATA or CAAT motifs.
Transcription is initiated at one major site.
Using deletion constructs, we have defined an active promoter region of 1056 bp.
Gel-shift assays revealed that transcriptional factor(s) induced only in response to IL-13 treatment of human peripheral blood monocytes bind to the 15-LO promoter DNA.
Two regions, DP1 (-140 to -92 bp) and DP2 (-353 to -304 bp) of the promoter were essential for transcription in HeLa cells and human peripheral monocytes.
Hela nuclear extracts contained a specific nuclear factor(s) binding to 15-LO promoter DNA which are distinct from those derived from IL-13-treated human peripheral monocyte nuclear extracts.
In addition, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) results refined the previous localization of 15-LO to human chromosome 17p13.3.
