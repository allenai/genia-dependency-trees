Regulation of B-cell commitment to plasma cells or to memory B cells.
During humoral immune responses, B-lymphocyte activation is followed by differentiation along either the plasma cell pathway or the memory B-cell pathway.
Recent studies suggest that CD40-CD40 ligand, OX-OX40 ligand, a group of cytokines and intracellular transcriptional factors may all contribute to B-lymphocyte differentiation control.
