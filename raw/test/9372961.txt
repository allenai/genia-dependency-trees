OCA-B is a functional analog of VP16 but targets a separate surface of the Oct-1 POU domain [published erratum appears in Mol Cell Biol 1998 Apr;18(4):2430]
OCA-B is a B-cell-specific coregulator of the broadly expressed POU domain transcription factor Oct-1.
OCA-B associates with the Oct-1 POU domain, a bipartite DNA-binding structure containing a POU-specific (POU[S]) domain joined by a flexible linker to a POU homeodomain (POU[H]).
Here, we show that OCA-B alters the activity of Oct-1 in two ways.
It provides a transcriptional activation domain which, unlike Oct-1, activates an mRNA-type promoter effectively, and it stabilizes Oct-1 on the Oct-1-responsive octamer sequence ATGCAAAT.
These properties of OCA-B parallel those displayed by the herpes simplex virus Oct-1 coregulator VP16.
OCA-B, however, interacts with a different surface of the DNA-bound Oct-1 POU domain, interacting with both the POU(S) and POU(H) domains and the center of the ATGCAAAT octamer sequence.
The OCA-B and VP16 interactions with the Oct-1 POU domain are sufficiently different to permit OCA-B and VP16 to bind the Oct-1 POU domain simultaneously.
These results emphasize the structural versatility of the Oct-1 POU domain in its interaction with coregulators.
