Differanisole A, a novel antitumor antibiotic, enhances growth inhibition and differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells induced by 9-cis retinoic acid.
Differanisole A, 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-n-propylbenzoic acid, inhibited growth of human myeloid leukemia cells.
The compound induced G1 arrest and granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, although the differentiation-inducing effect was modest.
Differanisole A and 9-cis retinoic acid (9cisRA) synergistically inhibited the growth and induced functional and morphologic differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 cells, whereas the combined treatment with differanisole A and all-trans retinoic acid or 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was less effective.
Similar results were obtained in primary culture of leukemia cells from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia.
The synergistic effect on growth inhibition and induction of differentiation required simultaneous treatment with differanisole A and 9cisRA.
Differanisole A and an RXR-specific ligand (Ro47-5944) cooperatively inhibited the cell growth, while the combined effect of differanisole A and an RAR-specific ligand Am80 was just additive.
Differanisole A in combination with 9cisRA may have implications for therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients.
