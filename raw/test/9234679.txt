A conserved tissue-specific structure at a human T-cell receptor beta-chain core promoter.
The T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain promoters have been characterized as nonstructured basal promoters that carry a single conserved ubiquitous cyclic AMP-responsive element.
Our investigation of the human TCR beta gene uncovers a surprisingly complex and tissue-specific structure at the TCR Vbeta 8.1 promoter.
The core of the promoter (positions -42 to +11) is recognized by the lymphoid cell-specific transcription factors Ets-1, LEF1, and AML1 as well as by CREB/ATF-1, as is demonstrated in gel shift and footprinting experiments.
With the exception of LEF1, these factors activate transcription in T cells.
Binding sites at the core region show little conservation with consensus sites.
Nonetheless, CREB, Ets-1, and AML1 bind and activate cooperatively and very efficiently through the nonconsensus binding sites at the core promoter region.
Moderate ubiquitous activation is further induced by CREB/ATF and Sp1 factors through proximal upstream elements.
The tissue-specific core promoter structure is apparently conserved in other T-cell-specifically expressed genes such as the CD4 gene.
Our observations suggest that both the enhancer and the promoter have a complex tissue-specific structure whose functional interplay potentiates T-cell-specific transcription.
