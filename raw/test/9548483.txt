Delta-opioid receptors expressed by Jurkat T cells enhance IL-2 secretion by increasing AP-1 complexes and activity of the NF-AT/AP-1-binding promoter element.
Recent molecular evidence points to transient and/or stage-specific expression of delta- and kappa-opioid receptors by thymic and peripheral T lymphocytes.
Since medical treatments or stress commonly increase opioid levels, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which opioids affect T lymphocyte functions.
We therefore created and studied a T cell line expressing the cloned delta-opioid receptor (DOR1).
DOR1 ligation by a specific DOR1 agonist, deltorphin, augmented IL-2 secretion by synergizing with signals from TCR-CD3 and CD28.
Reporter gene constructs were used to map this effect of deltorphin to the AP-1- and NF-AT/AP-1-binding sites of the IL-2 promoter.
Although DOR1 signaling increased [Ca2+]i, deltorphin enhanced transcriptional activity of the NF-AT/AP-1-binding site via a mechanism independent of calcineurin and distinct from the effects of elevated [Ca2+]i.
Deltorphin also increased accumulation of AP-1 transcription factor complexes, suggesting that DOR1 augments IL-2 secretion by increasing the AP-1 component of the NF-AT/AP-1 transcription factor.
These results advance the molecular understanding of opioid effects on lymphocytes, and in addition, demonstrate regulation of IL-2 synthesis and secretion by the novel mechanism of receptor-mediated AP-1 induction.
