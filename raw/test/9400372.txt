Molecular mechanisms of anoxia/reoxygenation-induced neutrophil adherence to cultured endothelial cells.
The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the time course of neutrophil adhesion to monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that were exposed to 60 minutes of anoxia followed by 30 to 600 minutes of reoxygenation and (2) define the mechanisms responsible for both the early (minutes) and late (hours) hyperadhesivity of postanoxic HUVECs to human neutrophils.
The results clearly demonstrate that anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R) leads to a biphasic increase in neutrophil adhesion to HUVECs, with peak responses occurring at 30 minutes (phase 1) and 240 minutes (phase 2) after reoxygenation.
Oxypurinol and catalase inhibited phase-1 adhesion, suggesting a role for xanthine oxidase and H2O2.
In comparison, platelet activating factor (PAF) contributed to both phases of neutrophil adhesion.
Anti-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and anti-P-selectin antibodies (monoclonal antibodies [mAbs]) attenuated phase-1 neutrophil adhesion, consistent with roles for constitutively expressed ICAM-1 and enhanced surface expression of preformed P-selectin.
Phase-2 neutrophil adhesion was attenuated by an anti-E-selectin mAb, indicating a dominant role of this adhesion molecule in the late phase response.
Pretreatment with actinomycin D and cycloheximide or with competing ds-oligonucleotides containing the nuclear factor-kappa B or activator protein-1 cognate DNA sequences significantly attenuated phase-2 response, suggesting a role for de novo macromolecule synthesis.
Surface expression of ICAM-1, P-selectin, and E-selectin on HUVECs correlated with the phase-1 and -2 neutrophil adhesion responses.
Collectively, these findings indicate that A/R elicits a two-phase neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion response that involves transcription-independent and transcription-dependent surface expression of different endothelial cell adhesion molecules.
