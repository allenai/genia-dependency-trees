Dominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to the immediate-early trans-activator protein, BZLF1, in persistent type A or B Epstein-Barr virus infection.
Five healthy human leukocyte antigen-B8 (HLA-B8)-positive virus carriers were studied to investigate the CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to an HLA-B8-restricted peptide, RAKFKQLLQ, located in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immediate-early trans-activator protein, BZLF1.
Of the 5 virus carriers, 4 were infected with type A and 1 with type B EBV.
Using limiting-dilution analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a high RAKFKQLLQ-specific CTL precursor frequency was demonstrated after specific peptide or autologous lymphoblastoid cell line stimulation in both type A and type B EBV carriers.
The RAKFKQLLQ-specific CTL precursor frequencies in all 5 persons were at least as dominant as those observed with two other EBV-associated, HLA-B8-restricted latent epitopes, FLRGRAYGL and QAKWRLQTL.
These findings show that healthy virus carriers maintain a high frequency of BZLF1-specific memory T cells, potentially to control virus spread from lytically infected cells.
