Differential interaction of nuclear factors with the leukocyte-specific pp52 promoter in B and T cells.
The leukocyte-specific, cytoskeleton-binding pp52 (LSP-1, WP-34) protein is widely expressed in multiple leukocyte lineages, including B and T lymphocytes, granulocytes, and macrophages.
We previously detected a tissue-specific promoter preceding the exon encoding the N terminus of the pp52 leukocyte protein.
Here we describe the functional characterization of this promoter and identification of the factors in B and T cells that regulate its activity.
The pp52 promoter contains an initiator specifying the unique 5' terminus of pp52 mRNA, tandem pairs of Ets and SP1 motifs, and a lone C/EBP motif.
All these motifs are essential and collectively control transcriptional activity.
DNA binding studies and Ab supershift assays revealed that different combinations of factors interact with these motifs in B cells vs T cells.
The Ets motifs are preferentially bound by PU-1 in B cell extracts from all stages of development, whereas a different Ets family member reacts with these motifs in T cell extracts.
The C/EBP motif is bound by Ig/EBP-1 in pre-B cell and T cell extracts, but is replaced by nuclear factor-IL-6beta or a nuclear factor-IL-6beta-Ig/EBP-1 heterodimer in plasmacytoma cell extracts.
Despite its reported role as a negative regulator of transcription, Ig/EBP-1 appears to exert a stimulatory effect on this promoter.
These findings reveal the features controlling the pp52 promoter in B and T cells and provide the foundation for determining the regulation of this promoter in other leukocyte lineages.
