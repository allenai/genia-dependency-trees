The A-myb transcription factor in neoplastic and normal B cells.
The myb family of transcription factors has been strongly implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation in the haematopoietic system.
The v-myb oncogene, carried by avian defective retroviruses, causes leukaemias in the chicken and transforms haematopoietic cells in vitro.
Its normal cellular equivalent c-myb, has been shown to promote the proliferation and block the differentiation of haematopoietic cells in several experimental models and is required for fetal haematopoiesis.
Two other members of the family have been cloned more recently, A-myb and B-myb, which show sequence homology with c-myb in several domains, of which the DNA binding domain as well as other regulatory domains.
Both have been shown to be transcription factors.
B-myb is also involved in the control of proliferation and differentiation, but, unlike c-myb, it is expressed in many cell types.
The third member of the family, A-myb, shows the most restricted pattern of expression, suggesting a very specific role for this transcription factor.
A-myb is expressed in a subpopulation of normal B lymphocytes activated in vivo and localised in the germinal center of peripheral lymphoid organs and is not detected at significant levels in all other mature or immature haematopoietic populations studied, including bone marrow cells, T lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, either at rest or after in vitro activation.
These studies indicate that A-myb plays a role during a narrow window of normal B cell differentiation.
A-myb expression has also been studied in a wide range of neoplastic B cells, representing the whole spectrum of B cell differentiation.
A-myb is strongly expressed in Burkitt's lymphomas (BL) and slg+ B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (B-ALL) and not in all other leukaemias/lymphomas tested, with the exception of a subset of CLL (about 25% of cases).
It is intriguing that the A-myb genome has been localised relatively close to the c-myc gene on chromosome 8, suggesting that the c-myc translocation in BL and B-ALL may affect A-myb transcription.
Studies are in progress to investigate the functional relationship between A-myb and c-myc, particularly in the context of BL cells and to determine whether A-myb is deregulated in these cells.
