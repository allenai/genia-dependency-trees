Loss- and gain-of-function mutations reveal an important role of BSAP (Pax-5) at the start and end of B cell differentiation.
Pax-5 codes for the transcription factor BSAP which is expressed throughout B cell development except in terminally differentiated plasma cells.
Gene targeting experiments in the mouse revealed a differential dependency of fetal and adult B-lymphopoiesis on this transcription factor.
BSAP is required for B-lineage commitment in the fetal liver and for progression beyond an early pro-B cell stage in adult bone marrow.
The characterization of Pax-5-deficient pro-B cells demonstrated an important role of BSAP in the regulation of the CD19, mb-1 (Ig alpha) and N-myc genes as well as in the developmental pathway controlling VH-to-DHJH recombination at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) locus.
The human PAX-5 gene was recently shown to participate together with the IgH locus in the chromosomal translocation t(9;14)(p13;q32).
This translocation is characteristic of a small subset of non-Hodgkin lymphomas exhibiting plasmacytoid differentiation.
The translocated PAX-5 gene is deregulated by the insertion of IgH regulatory elements into its 5' region, which may contribute to tumorigenesis by interfering with the shut-down of PAX-5 transcription and thus with the completion of plasma cell differentiation.
