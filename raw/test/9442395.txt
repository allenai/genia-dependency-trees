Temporal control of IgH gene expression in developing B cells by the 3' locus control region.
The suggested roles of the downstream 3' regions acting as a Locus Control Region (LCR), have allowed comparisons to be made between the regulation of the IgH locus with other model systems whose gene expression is governed by LCR activity.
Here we summarize the importance of the IgH 3'LCR and its putative functional role in IgH gene expression and compare it with the 5'LCR regulatory region of the human beta-globin locus.
