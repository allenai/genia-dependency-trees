HMG box containing transcription factors in lymphocyte differentiation.
The identification of the mammalian sex-determining gene Sry has led to the discovery of a large family of related ('HMG box') transcription factors that control developmental events in yeast, C. elegans, Drosophila and vertebrates.
In lymphocyte differentiation, several HMG box proteins play a decisive role.
Sox-4 is important for very early B-cell differentiation, while TCF-1/LEF-1 play a crucial role in early thymocyte development.
TCF/LEF proteins have recently been found to constitute a downstream component of the Wingless/Wnt signal transduction pathway.
In flies, this pathway controls segment polarity; in Xenopus it controls the definition of the body axis.
Deregulation of the pathway occurs in several human tumors.
These insights in the molecular events that are involved in TCF/LEF function in these organisms may eventually lead to the understanding of the function of these HMG box proteins in lymphoid development.
