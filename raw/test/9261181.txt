Transcription factor GATA-3 is differentially expressed in murine Th1 and Th2 cells and controls Th2-specific expression of the interleukin-5 gene.
Interleukin-5 (IL-5), which is produced by CD4(+) T helper 2 (Th2) cells, but not by Th1 cells, plays a key role in the development of eosinophilia in asthma.
Despite increasing evidence that the outcome of many diseases is determined by the ratio of the two subsets of CD4(+) T helper cells, Th1 and Th2, the molecular basis for Th1- and Th2- specific gene expression remains to be elucidated.
We previously established a critical role for the transcription factor GATA-3 in IL-5 promoter activation in EL-4 cells, which express both Th1- and Th2-type cytokines.
Our studies reported here demonstrate that GATA-3 is critical for expression of the IL-5 gene in bona fide Th2 cells.
Whereas mutations in the GATA-3 site abolished antigen- or cAMP- stimulated IL-5 promoter activation in Th2 cells, ectopic expression of GATA-3 in Th1 cells or in a non-lymphoid, non-IL-5-producing cell line activated the IL-5 promoter.
During the differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells isolated from T cell receptor transgenic mice, GATA-3 gene expression was up-regulated in developing Th2 cells, but was down-regulated in Th1 cells, and antigen- or cAMP-activated Th2 cells (but not Th1 cells) expressed the GATA-3 protein.
Thus, GATA-3 may play an important role in the balance between Th1 and Th2 subsets in immune responses.
Inhibition of GATA-3 activity has therapeutic potential in the treatment of asthma and other hypereosinophilic diseases.
