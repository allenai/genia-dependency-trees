Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in bacterial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages.
Activation of macrophages by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces transcription of genes that encode for proinflammatory regulators of the immune response.
Previous work has suggested that activation of the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) is one LPS-induced event that mediates this response.
Consistent with this notion, we found that LPS stimulated AP-1-mediated transcription of a transfected reporter gene in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7.
As AP-1 activity is regulated in part by activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates and subsequently increases the transcriptional activity of c-Jun, we examined whether LPS treatment of macrophages resulted in activation of this kinase.
LPS treatment of RAW 264.7 cells, murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, and the human monocyte cell line THP-1 resulted in rapid activation of the p46 and p54 isoforms of JNK.
Treatment with wild-type and rough mutant forms of LPS and synthetic lipid A resulted in JNK activation, while pretreatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A inhibited this response.
Binding of LPS-LPS binding protein (LBP) complexes to CD14, a surface receptor that mediates many LPS responses, was found to be crucial, as pretreatment of THP-1 cells with the monoclonal antibody 60b, which blocks this binding, inhibited JNK activation.
These results suggest that LPS activation of JNK in monocyte/macrophage cells is a CD14- and protein tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent event that may mediate the early activation of AP-1 in regulating LPS-triggered gene induction.
