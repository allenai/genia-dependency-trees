HIV type 1 protease activation of NF-kappa B within T lymphoid cells.
NF-kappa B is a nuclear protein of the rel oncogene family capable of enhancing transcription of several cellular genes, including IL-2 and the IL-2 receptor, and viral genes transcribed from the HIV-1 LTR.
It has been reported that HIV-1 protease may cleave the NF-kappa B precursor to its active form in vitro.
In this study the effects of HIV protease on NF-kappa B precursor activation were examined in Jurkat T cells by introducing a protease expression vector into the cells.
Increased NF-kappa B activity was observed and this increased activity was blocked by a specific inhibitor of the viral protease.
Viral transcription, as measured using LTR-CAT assays, was only slightly enhanced in the HIV-protease expressing cells, while secretion of IL-2 and expression of the IL-2 receptor were not affected.
The limited activation of NF-kappa B by HIV protease appears unlikely to have a significant effect on virus expression or T cell function.
