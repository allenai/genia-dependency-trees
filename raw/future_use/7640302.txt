Regulation of c-jun mRNA expression by hydroxyurea in human K562 cells during erythroid differentiation [published erratum appears in Biochim Biophys Acta 1995 Dec 27;1264(3):409]
Hydroxyurea (HU) is an antitumor agent which also induces hemoglobinization during erythroid differentiation.
In addition, HU stimulates the synthesis of fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell anemia patients.
To further understand its mechanism of action, we investigated the effects of HU on regulation of c-jun expression prior to the onset of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells.
HU induced a dose-dependent stimulation of c-jun synthesis.
The levels of c-jun mRNA was elevated 4 to 7.5-fold by HU within 2 h.
This was followed by a gradual decline to the basal level by 24 h.
Both nuclear run-on and actinomycin D pulse experiments strongly indicate that HU regulates c-jun mRNA expression by increasing the rate of synthesis as well as stabilizing the c-jun mRNA.
In addition, the level of jun protein was elevated by 2 to 5-fold within 4 h in HU treated cells.
Furthermore, concentrations of HU below 250 microM slightly increased the 5X AP-1/CAT activity.
These results strongly suggest that HU induces both transcriptional and post-transcription regulation of c-jun during erythroid differentiation.
