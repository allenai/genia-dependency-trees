Expression of Id2 and Id3 mRNA in human lymphocytes.
Helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors are involved in cellular growth and differentiation.
The Id (inhibitor of DNA binding and differentiation) HLH proteins, in a dominantly negative fashion, regulate transcriptional activities of basic HLH proteins.
We examined by northern hybridization the expression of Id2 and Id3 mRNA in human leukemia/lymphoma lines and patient samples, as well as resting and activated normal human lymphocytes from peripheral blood (PBL).
The Id2 mRNA was abundantly expressed in 5/12 T-cell and 3/4 B-cell lines, and Id3 mRNA was detected in 4/12 T-cell and 3/4 B-cell lines.
Interestingly, Id2, but not Id3, mRNA was strongly expressed in 4/5 T-cell lines infected with human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) (ATL-1k, MT-2, S-LB1) and type II (Mo).
Another unexpected finding was that T-cell leukemias and T-cell lines often expressed either Id2 or Id3 mRNA.
In addition, resting PBL constitutively expressed prominent levels of Id2 mRNA, but not Id3 mRNA.
Upon PHA-stimulation, Id2 expression decreased and Id3 levels increased with biphasic kinetics.
Taken together, our studies revealed three unexpected findings which require further analysis: (1) expression of Id2 mRNA is often associated with lymphocytic transformation by HTLV-I or -II; (2) T-cells usually express either Id2 or Id3 mRNA, but B-cells often express both simultaneously; (3) non-dividing, normal PBL express high levels of Id2 and no Id3 mRNA; and with the onset of cellular proliferation, levels of Id2 mRNA decrease while levels of Id3 mRNA increase, suggesting that regulation of expression of these closely related genes is disparate.
