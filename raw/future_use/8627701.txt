Cyclic AMP-responsive element-dependent activation of Epstein-Barr virus zebra promoter by human herpesvirus 6.
We have recently shown that infection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome-positive B cells by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) results in the expression of the immediate-early EBV Zebra gene, followed by virus replication (L.Flamand, I.Stefanescu, D.V.Ablashi, and J.Menezes, J.Virol.67:6768-6777, 1993).
Here we show that HHV-6 upregulates Zebra gene transcription through a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE) located within the Zebra promoter (Zp).
Using human B- or T-cell lines transfected with ZpCat reporter gene constructs, we demonstrate that a region designated the ZII domain of Zp is the target of HHV-6 transactivation.
Mutation of the consensus AP-1/CRE site within ZII abolished the inducibility of Zp by HHV-6, whereas positioning of the ZII domain upstream of the beta-globin minimal promoter conferred responsiveness following HHV-6 infection.
Binding of these factors to ZII was prevented by oligonucleotides containing CRE but not by AP-1 consensus sequences.
Antibodies against CRE-binding (CREB) protein but not against c-Fos or c-Jun were able to supershift the DNA-protein complex, identifying the nature of the transcription factor which binds to ZII as a member of the CREB family of proteins.
Finally, transfection of CREB protein and protein kinase A expression vectors were found to activate Zp in Jurkat cells, suggesting that phosphorylated form of CREB protein can play a determining role in the EBV reactivation process.
