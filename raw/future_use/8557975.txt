MEK1 and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases are required for the stimulation of IL-2 gene transcription in T cells.
TCR engagement stimulates the activation of the protein kinase Raf-1.
Active Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), which in turn phosphorylates and activates the MAP kinases/extracellular signal regulated kinases, ERK1 and ERK2.
Raf-1 activity promotes IL-2 production in activated T lymphocytes.
Therefore, we sought to determine whether MEK1 and ERK activities also stimulate IL-2 gene transcription.
Expression of constitutively active Raf-1 or MEK1 in Jurkat T cells enhanced the stimulation of IL-2 promoter-driven transcription stimulated by a calcium ionophore and PMA, and together with a calcium ionophore the expression of each protein was sufficient to stimulate NF-AT activity.
Expression of MEK1-interfering mutants inhibited the stimulation of IL-2 promoter-driven transcription and blocked the ability of constitutively active Ras and Raf-1 to costimulate NF-AT activity with a calcium ionophore.
Expression of the MAP kinase-specific phosphatase, MKP-1, which blocks ERK activation, inhibited IL-2 promoter and NF-AT-driven transcription stimulated by a calcium ionophore and PMA, and in addition, MKP-1 neutralized the transcriptional enhancement caused by active Raf-1 and MEK1 expression.
We conclude that the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway consisting of Raf-1, MEK1, and ERK1 and ERK2 functions in the stimulation IL-2 gene transcription in activated T lymphocytes.
