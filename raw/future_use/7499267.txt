Triggering of the human interleukin-6 gene by interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in monocytic cells involves cooperation between interferon regulatory factor-1, NF kappa B, and Sp1 transcription factors.
We investigated the molecular basis of the synergistic induction by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)/tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene in THP-1 monocytic cells, and compared it with the basis of this induction by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
Functional studies with IL-6 promoter demonstrated that three regions are the targets of the IFN-gamma and/or TNF-alpha action, whereas only one of these regions seemed to be implicated in LPS activation.
The three regions concerned are: 1) a region between -73 and -36, which is the minimal element inducible by LPS or TNF-alpha; 2) an element located between -181 and -73, which appeared to regulate the response to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha negatively; and 3) a distal element upstream of -224, which was inducible by IFN-gamma alone.
LPS signaling was found to involve NF kappa B activation by the p50/p65 heterodimers.
Synergistic induction of the IL-6 gene by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, in monocytic cells, involved cooperation between the IRF-1 and NF kappa B p65 homodimers with concomitant removal of the negative effect of the retinoblastoma control element present in the IL-6 promoter.
This removal occurred by activation of the constitutive Sp1 factor, whose increased binding activity and phosphorylation were mediated by IFN-gamma.
