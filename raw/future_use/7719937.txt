Identification and purification of human Stat proteins activated in response to interleukin-2.
A key cytokine induced during the immune response is IL-2.
Following T cell activation, the genes encoding IL-2 and the various chains of its receptor are transcriptionally induced.
In turn, secreted IL-2 serves to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes.
Several recent studies have implicated Jak kinases in the signaling pathway induced by IL-2.
Following this lead, we set out to identify transcription factors induced in response to IL-2.
Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were observed to contain several IL-2-inducible DNA binding activities.
Similar activities were also observed in a transformed human lymphocyte line, termed YT.
We have purified these activities and found that the principal IL-2-inducible component bears significant relatedness to a prolactin-induced transcription factor first identified in sheep mammary gland tissue.
We hypothesize that activation of this protein, designated hStat5, helps govern the biological effects of IL-2 during the immune response.
