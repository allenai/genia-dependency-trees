High frequency of germ-line BRCA2 mutations among Hungarian male breast cancer patients without family history.
To determine the contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations to the pathogenesis of male breast cancer in Hungary, the country with the highest male breast cancer mortality rates in continental Europe, a series of 18 male breast cancer patients and three patients with gynecomastia was analyzed for germ-line mutations in both BRCA1 and BRCA2.
Although no germ-line BRCA1 mutation was observed, 6 of the 18 male breast cancer cases (33%) carried truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene.
Unexpectedly, none of them reported a family history for breast/ovarian cancer.
Four of six truncating mutations were novel, and two mutations were recurrent.
Four patients (22%) had a family history of breast/ovarian cancer in at least one first- or second-degree relative; however, no BRCA2 mutation was identified among them.
No mutation was identified in either of the genes in the gynecomastias.
These results provide evidence for a strong genetic component of male breast cancer in Hungary.
