Multiple p21ras effector pathways regulate nuclear factor of activated T cells.
The transcription factor, Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) is a major target for p21ras and calcium signalling pathways in the IL-2 gene and is induced by p21ras signals acting in synergy with calcium/calcineurin signals.
One p21ras effector pathway involves the MAP kinase ERK-2, and we have examined its role in NFAT regulation.
Expression of dominant negative MAPKK-1 prevents NFAT induction.
Constitutively active MAPKK-1 fully activates ERK-2 and the transcription factor Elk-1, but does not substitute for activated p21ras and synergize with calcium/calcineurin signals to induce NFAT.
Expression of dominant negative N17Rac also prevents TCR and p21ras activation of NFAT, but without interfering with the ERK-2 pathway.
The transcriptional activity of the NFAT binding site is mediated by a complex comprising a member of the NFAT group and AP-1 family proteins.
The induction of AP-1 by p21ras also requires Rac-1 function.
Activated Rac-1 could mimic activated p21ras to induce AP-1 but not to induce NFAT.
Moreover, the combination of activated MAPKK-1 and Rac-1 could not substitute for activated p21ras and synergize with calcium signals to induce NFAT.
Thus, p21ras regulation of NFAT in T cells requires the activity of multiple effector pathways including those regulated by MAPKK-1/ERK-2 and Rac-1.
