Cutting edge: expression of the NF of activated T cells in eosinophils: regulation by IL-4 and IL-5.
We report that NF-AT1 and NF-AT4 are expressed cytoplasmically in resting eosinophils, whereas NF-AT2 and NF-AT3 have not been seen.
Likewise, NF-AT1 mRNA and NF-AT4 mRNA have been detected in resting eosinophils, and their levels can be significantly up-regulated by the Th2-associated cytokines IL-4 and IL-5.
There is no detectable NF-AT protein expression in the nuclei of resting eosinophils.
However NF-ATs appear in the nuclei of IL-4-, IL-5-, or ionomycin-stimulated eosinophils.
Only NF-AT1 and NF-AT4, but not NF-AT2 and NF-AT3, have translocated into the nuclei in IL-4- or IL-5-stimulated eosinophils.
These findings delineate a novel pathway in the cytokine network in which Th2 lymphocytes "control" eosinophils via the release of IL-4 and IL-5, and activation of NF-AT in eosinophils.
The findings also suggest that a later feedback "talking" may exist between eosinophils and Th2 lymphocytes.
