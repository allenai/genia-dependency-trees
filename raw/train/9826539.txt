Spi-1/PU.1 proto-oncogene induces opposite effects on monocytic and erythroid differentiation of K562 cells.
Spi-1/PU.1 is a hematopoietic transcription factor of the Ets family.
To analyze the effects of ectopic expression of spi-1 on the proliferation/differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells, K562 cells were stably transfected with a spi-1 expression vector.
The transfected cell lines expressed elevated levels of spi-1 mRNA and protein and high Spi-1-DNA binding activity.
The spi-1 transfected cells showed reduced growth rates and reduced clonogenic cell growth.
When the erythroid and monocytic differentiation markers were analyzed, spi-1 overexpression resulted in opposite effects: erythroid differentiation was significantly inhibited in spi-1 transfectants, while spi-1 overexpression increased the monocytic differentiation of cells.
These results indicate a differential role of Spi-1 on the differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells.
