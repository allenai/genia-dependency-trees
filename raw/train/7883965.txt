Missense mutation in exon 7 of the common gamma chain gene causes a moderate form of X-linked combined immunodeficiency.
Clinical and immunologic features of a recently recognized X-linked combined immunodeficiency disease (XCID) suggested that XCID and X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) might arise from different genetic defects.
The recent discovery of mutations in the common gamma chain (gamma c) gene, a constituent of several cytokine receptors, in XSCID provided an opportunity to test directly whether a previously unrecognized mutation in this same gene was responsible for XCID.
The status of X chromosome inactivation in blood leukocytes from obligate carriers of XCID was determined from the polymorphic, short tandem repeats (CAG), in the androgen receptor gene, which also contains a methylation-sensitive HpaII site.
As in XSCID, X-chromosome inactivation in obligate carriers of XCID was nonrandom in T and B lymphocytes.
In addition, X chromosome inactivation in PMNs was variable.
Findings from this analysis prompted sequencing of the gamma c gene in this pedigree.
A missense mutation in the region coding for the cytoplasmic portion of the gamma c gene was found in three affected males but not in a normal brother.
Therefore, this point mutation in the gamma c gene leads to a less severe degree of deficiency in cellular and humoral immunity than that seen in XSCID.
