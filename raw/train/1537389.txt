Interleukin 6-induced differentiation of a human B cell line into IgM-secreting plasma cells is mediated by c-fos.
The role of the protooncogene c-fos in interleukin (IL) 6-induced B cell differentiation was assessed.
Treatment of SKW 6.4 cells with IL 6 induced a transient and early stimulation of c-fos sense mRNA expression.
The effect appeared within 30 min and returned to basal levels after 2 h.
The addition of antisense oligonucleotides to c-fos significantly inhibited IL 6-induced IgM production by SKW 6.4 cells (p less than 0.001), whereas control oligonucleotides had no inhibitory effect.
These results indicate that activation of c-fos is involved in IL 6-induced differentiation of SKW 6.4 cells into IgM-secreting cells.
