Adherence-dependent increase in human monocyte PDGF(B) mRNA is associated with increases in c-fos, c-jun, and EGR2 mRNA.
Adherence is an important initial step in the transition of a circulating monocyte to a tissue macrophage.
This differentiation is accompanied by an augmented capacity to generate growth factors.
We hypothesized that adherence itself might be an important trigger for a sequence of gene activation culminating in cells with increased mRNA encoding profibrotic growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor B subunit (PDGF[B]) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta).
After in vitro adherence, human monocytes had a biphasic increase in PDGF(B) mRNA with peaks at 6 h and 13 d.
No increase in TGF-beta mRNA was observed.
The 6-h increase in PDGF(B) mRNA was adherence dependent, and in addition, was abrogated when the cytoskeletal integrity was compromised by cytochalasin D.
The 6-h increase in PDGF(B) mRNA was unaltered by adherence in the presence of the monocyte stimulus lipopolysaccharide.
Adherence to either fibronectin or collagen-coated plastic had little consistent effect on PDGF(B) mRNA accumulation.
The increased PDGF(B) mRNA observed in adherent monocytes was accompanied by increases in mRNAs of the early growth response genes c-fos (maximal at 20 min), c-jun, and EGR2 (maximal at 6-24 h).
The increase in c-jun and EGR2, but not c-fos, mRNA was also abrogated by cytochalasin D.
These observations suggest that adherence results in increases of c-fos, c-jun, EGR2, and PDGF(B) mRNA.
In addition, the increases in c-jun, EGR2, and PDGF(B) may depend on cytoskeletal rearrangement.
Modulation of these events at the time of adherence offers a mechanism by which differential priming of the cells may be accomplished.
