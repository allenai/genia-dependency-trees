Characterization of a novel T lymphocyte protein which binds to a site related to steroid/thyroid hormone receptor response elements in the negative regulatory sequence of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat.
We have previously identified a T lymphocyte protein which binds to a site within the LTR of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and exerts an inhibitory effect on virus gene expression.
The palindromic site (site B) recognized by this protein is related to the palindromic binding sites of members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family.
Here we characterize the T cell protein binding to this site as a 100 kD protein which is most abundant in T cells and which binds to site B as a 200 kD complex.
This protein is distinct from other members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family including the COUP protein which has a closely related DNA binding specificity.
