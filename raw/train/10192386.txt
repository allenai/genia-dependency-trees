A human IFNGR1 small deletion hotspot associated with dominant susceptibility to mycobacterial infection [see comments]
The immunogenetic basis of severe infections caused by bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine and environmental mycobacteria in humans remains largely unknown.
We describe 18 patients from several generations of 12 unrelated families who were heterozygous for 1 to 5 overlapping IFNGR1 frameshift small deletions and a wild-type IFNGR1 allele.
There were 12 independent mutation events at a single mutation site, defining a small deletion hotspot.
Neighbouring sequence analysis favours a small deletion model of slipped mispairing events during replication.
The mutant alleles encode cell-surface IFNgamma receptors that lack the intra-cytoplasmic domain, which, through a combination of impaired recycling, abrogated signalling and normal binding to IFNgamma exert a dominant-negative effect.
We thus report a hotspot for human IFNGR1 small deletions that confer dominant susceptibility to infections caused by poorly virulent mycobacteria.
