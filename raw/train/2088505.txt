A novel T-cell trans-activator that recognizes a phorbol ester-inducible element of the interleukin-2 promoter.
The interleukin 2 (IL-2) gene promoter is recognized by several cell-type-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators that integrate information transmitted by various signaling systems leading to IL-2 production and T-cell activation.
Using a combination of transfection, protein-DNA binding, and in vitro transcription methods, we have discovered the novel T-cell-specific transcriptional activator TCF-1 (for T-Cell Factor-1), which recognizes a T-cell-specific response element (TCE) located within the IL-2 promoter.
Although the TCE is similar in sequence to a consensus NF kappa B site, several criteria indicate that TCF-1 is distinct from NF kappa B.
However, like NF kappa B, TCF-1 activity is induced by phorbol esters and other T-cell activators.
