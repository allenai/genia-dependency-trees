USF-related transcription factor, HIV-TF1, stimulates transcription of human immunodeficiency virus-1.
The transcription factor HIV-TF1, which binds to a region about 60 bp upstream from the enhancer of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), was purified from human B cells.
HIV-TF1 had a molecular weight of 39,000.
Binding of HIV-TF1 to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) activated transcription from the HIV promoter in vitro.
The HIV-TF1-binding site in HIV LTR was similar to the site recognized by upstream stimulatory factor (USF) in the adenovirus major late promoter.
DNA-binding properties of HIV-TF1 suggested that HIV-TF1 might be identical or related to USF.
Interestingly, treatment of purified HIV-TF1 by phosphatase greatly reduced its DNA-binding activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of HIV-TF1 was essential for DNA binding.
The disruption of HIV-TF1-binding site induced a 60% decrease in the level of transcription from the HIV promoter in vivo.
These results suggest that HIV-TF1 is involved in transcriptional regulation of HIV-1.
