[Effect of antihypertensive therapy with captopril on gluco- and mineralocorticoid receptors of peripheral blood lymphocytes in hypertensive patients of various age]
Binding of 3H-dexamethasone and 3H-aldosterone by peripheral lymphocyte receptors was investigated in healthy persons and hypertensive patients before and after 2-week captopril treatment.
The number of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid binding sites was increased in hypertensives vs normotensives.
The treatment with the ACE inhibitor captopril led to activation of hormone-receptor interactions.
There was a more marked rise of the number of receptors in middle-aged (44-55 years) hypertensives vs elderly (61-80 years) subjects after captopril treatment.
