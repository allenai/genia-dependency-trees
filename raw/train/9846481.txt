Adaptor function for the Syk kinases-interacting protein 3BP2 in IL-2 gene activation.
Syk-family tyrosine kinases are essential for lymphocyte development and activation.
Using a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify Syk kinases-interacting proteins (SKIPs), we isolated 3BP2, an Abl SH3-interacting protein of unknown function.
3BP2 was selectively expressed in hematopoietic/lymphoid tissues and bound via its SH2 domain activated Syk-family kinases in mammalian cells, including in antigen receptor-stimulated T cells.
In addition to Zap-70, the 3BP2 SH2 domain associated in vitro with LAT, Grb2, PLCgamma1, and Cbl from activated T cell lysates.
Transient 3BP2 overexpression induced transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter and its NFAT or AP-1 elements.
This activity was dependent on the SH2 and pleckstrin-homology domains of 3BP2, and required functional Syk kinases, Ras, and calcineurin.
Thus, 3BP2 is an important adaptor that may couple activated Zap-70/Syk to a LAT-containing signaling complex involved in TCR-mediated gene transcription.
