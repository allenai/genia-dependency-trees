Chromosome 1 aneusomy with 1p36 under-representation is related to histologic grade, DNA aneuploidy, high c-erb B-2 and loss of bcl-2 expression in ductal breast carcinoma.
Chromosome 1 abnormalities with loss of 1p36 have been investigated in 95 breast-cancer samples by means of a dual-target fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) technique using the pUC 1.77 and p1-79 probes, specific for the 1q12 and 1p36 regions, respectively.
Abnormalities for one or both probes were detected in 83/95 samples.
Relative 1p36 under-representation was found in 79/95.
The clinical relevance of these alterations was studied by comparing the FISH results with several parameters currently used in breast-cancer pathology.
Distinct patterns of chromosome 1 abnormalities were found among the histologic types of breast carcinoma.
Lobular or mucinous samples showed few or no alterations, whereas most ductal samples had high chromosome 1 polysomy with under-representation of 1p36.
In ductal carcinomas, chromosome 1 alterations increased with histologic grade, DNA aneuploidy, loss of bcl-2 and high c-erb B-2 expression.
These associations were found to be statistically significant.
No correlation between chromosome 1 alterations and nuclear grade, age, size, lymph-node involvement, hormonal receptor presence, proliferation activity or p53 protein expression was detected.
These results indicate the utility of this FISH technique for a better definition of the biological characteristics of ductal carcinomas.
