Binding of HMG-I(Y) elicits structural changes in a silencer of the human beta-globin gene.
Proteins involved in repression of the human beta-globin gene may be useful in the treatment of sickle cell anemia, in conjunction with therapy to reactivate fetal globin genes.
If there is a reciprocal elevation of gamma-globin expression upon repression, this approach could be useful in additional hemoglobinopathies.
We previously showed that repression of the beta-globin gene appears to be mediated through two DNA sequences, silencers I and II, and identified a protein termed BP1 which binds to both silencer sequences.
In this study, we cloned two cDNAs encoding proteins which bind to an oligonucleotide in silencer I containing a BP1 binding site.
These cDNAs correspond to HMG-I and HMG-Y, isoforms regarded as architectural proteins.
We demonstrate that binding of HMG-I(Y) to this oligonucleotide causes bending/flexure of the DNA.
HMG-I(Y) also binds to a second oligonucleotide containing a BP1 binding site located in a negative control region upstream of the delta-globin gene, suggesting a role for HMG-I(Y) in repression of adult globin genes.
Expression studies revealed that HMG-I(Y) is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues that do not express beta-globin, being present in 48 of 50 tissues and six hematopoietic cell lines examined.
Furthermore, HMG-I(Y) expression is down-regulated during differentiation of primary erythroid cells.
We present a model in which HMG-I(Y) alters DNA conformation to allow binding of repressor proteins, and in which the relative amount of HMG-I(Y) helps to determine the repressive state of the beta-globin gene.
