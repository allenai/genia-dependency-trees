Regulation of fas-ligand expression during activation-induced cell death in T lymphocytes via nuclear factor kappaB.
T cell receptor engagement activates transcription factors important for cytokine gene regulation.
Additionally, this signaling pathway also leads to activation-induced apoptosis in T lymphocytes that is dependent on FasL transcription and expression.
Here we demonstrate that nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of many cytokine genes expressed in activated lymphocytes, also plays a role in T cell activation-induced FasL expression.
Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity in a T cell hybridoma leads to decreased FasL expression and apoptosis upon T cell receptor stimulation.
We identified the NF-kappaB site in the FasL promoter that contributes to such regulation.
Co-expression of p65 (Rel A) with the FasL promoter enhanced its activity, and co-expression of IkappaB dramatically inhibited the inducible promoter activity.
In contrast, the transcription factor AP-1 is not required for activation-induced FasL promoter activity.
These results define a role for NF-kappaB in mediating FasL expression during T cell activation.
