MHC class II signaling in B-cell activation [see comments]
The cognate interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), mediated by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, results in the delivery of activation signals to the APC.
These signals contribute to the expression of co-stimulatory activity by APCs and have important consequences for cell effector function.
MHC class II molecules also serve as receptors for B-cell stimulation by microbial superantigens.
In this review, Paul Scholl and Raif Geha discuss recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms of MHC class II signaling and analyse their role in human B-cell activation.
