Protective effects of notch-1 on TCR-induced apoptosis.
The Notch receptor protein was originally identified in Drosophila and is known to mediate cell to cell communication and influence cell fate decisions.
Members of this family have been isolated from invertebrates as well as vertebrates.
We isolated mouse Notch-1 in a yeast two-hybrid screen with Nur77, which is a protein that has been shown previously to be required for apoptosis in T cell lines.
The data presented below indicate that Notch-1 expression provides significant protection to T cell lines from TCR-mediated apoptosis.
These data demonstrate a new antiapoptotic role for Notch-1, providing evidence that, in addition to regulating cell fate decisions, Notch-1 can play a critical role in controlling levels of cell death in T cells.
