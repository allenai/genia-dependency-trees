Translocation breakpoints in three patients with campomelic dysplasia and autosomal sex reversal map more than 130 kb from SOX9.
Campomelic dysplasia (CMPD1) and autosomal XY sex reversal (SRA1) are caused by mutations in the SRY-related gene SOX9 on 17q.
Unexpectedly, the 17q breakpoints in four CMPD1 translocation cases previously analyzed by us and others map 50 kb or more from SOX9.
Here, we present clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular data from a new CMPD1/SRA1 patient with t(6;17)(q14;q24).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization has shown that the 17q breakpoint in this case maps to the same region as the breakpoints in the other translocation cases, at least 130 kb from SOX9.
Likewise, the breakpoints in two of the previously described cases also map more than 130 kb and, as shown by pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis, at most 400 kb or 690 kb from SOX9.
By using a SOX9 coding sequence polymorphism, expression of both SOX9 alleles has been demonstrated by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in lymphoblastoid cells from one of the translocation cases.
