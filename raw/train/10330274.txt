Paradoxical priming effects of IL-10 on cytokine production.
IL-10 is a well-known immunosuppressive and/or anti-inflammatory cytokine.
However, we report in vitro experimental studies in which IL-10 primed leukocytes and led to an enhanced production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) upon further stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
Monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) prepared from whole blood maintained for 20 h at 37 degrees C in the presence of recombinant human IL-10 had an enhanced capacity to produce TNF in response to LPS.
In addition to TNF, LPS-induced IL-6 and spontaneous IL-1ra production were also enhanced.
When isolated PBMC were first cultured for 20 h in the presence of IL-10 on Teflon to prevent adherence, washed to remove IL-10 and then further cultured in plastic dishes for an additional 20 h in the presence of LPS or IL-1beta, an enhanced release of TNF was observed.
This was not the case when PBMC were pre-cultured in plastic multidishes in the presence of IL-10.
TNF mRNA expression induced by LPS was decreased when the pre-treatment of PBMC with IL-10 was performed on plastic, whereas this was not the case when cells were pre-cultured with IL-10 on Teflon.
Furthermore, NFkappaB translocation following LPS activation was higher after IL-10 pre-treatment on Teflon than on plastic.
Interestingly, an enhanced frequency of CD16 and CD68(+) cells among the CD14(+) cells was observed in the presence of IL-10, independently of the pre-culture conditions of the PBMC.
Altogether, these results indicate that the IL-10-induced up-regulation of cytokine production depends on the prevention of monocyte adherence by red cells in the whole blood assays or by cultures of PBMC on Teflon.
In contrast, the adherence parameter has no effect on the IL-10-induced modulation of some monocyte surface markers.
