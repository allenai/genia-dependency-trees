Calcitriol: a hematolymphopoietrope? [editorial]
A MEDLINE search of the English-language literature was conducted using the indexing terms 'immunology, calcitriol and vitamin D' to identify studies indicating a role for calcitriol as a primary immunomodulator.
Sixty-six papers published between January 1956 and June 1991 were identified.
Forty-five of these reports are cited in this review.
The data strongly suggest an endocrine, autocrine and/or paracrine role for calcitriol in immune regulation.
No unifying hypothesis has yet emerged explaining this collection of data.
This paper provides a brief review of immune properties currently attributed to calcitriol.
