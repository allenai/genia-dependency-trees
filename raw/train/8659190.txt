Transcription factors of T and B lymphocytes--basic research and clinical perspectives for gastroenterology.
Tissue specific regulation of gene expression by transcription factors is a fascinating new field in molecular immunology.
This review summarizes data on specific regulation of promoters and enhancers by nuclear trans-acting factors in lymphocytes.
The structural classes of transcription factors are described and basic methods for detection and analysis of transcription factors are detailed.
Furthermore, the most important trans-acting factors of T and B lymphocytes (e.g. NF-kB, NF-AT and STAT families) and their functional importance are described.
Several methods for specific down-regulation of transcription factors are shown that may be relevant to treatment of human disease.
The data are discussed with regard to their potential clinical relevance for gastroenterology.
