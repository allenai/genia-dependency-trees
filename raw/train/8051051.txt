Mitogen activation of human peripheral T lymphocytes induces the formation of new cyclic AMP response element-binding protein nuclear complexes.
A large body of evidence indicates that experimental agents which raise cellular cAMP levels inhibit T cell growth and division.
By contrast, many studies have reported that mitogen activation of T cells increases cAMP levels, implying a positive physiological role for cAMP in the activation process.
In the present study we demonstrate that mitogen activation of human peripheral T lymphocytes induces nuclear factors that form complexes with cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB).
Four complexes are identified by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, two of which are induced by mitogen activation.
All four complexes contain CREB and are bound to the cAMP response element (CRE) core sequence (TGACGTCA), as indicated by antibody and oligonucleotide competition experiments.
Binding of the four complexes to CRE is prevented by dephosphorylation of nuclear extracts and is restored by rephosphorylation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase or endogenous kinases.
Similar complexes are detected in nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells.
Mitogen induction of the electrophoretic mobility shift assay complexes is not accounted for by protein phosphorylation or by induction of CREB.
Rather, the data indicate that mitogen increases the levels of a nuclear factor(s) that dimerizes with CREB.
Induction of new CREB complexes implies a physiological role for cAMP in mitogen activation of T lymphocytes.
