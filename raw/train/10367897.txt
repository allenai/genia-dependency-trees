CBP/p300 integrates Raf/Rac-signaling pathways in the transcriptional induction of NF-ATc during T cell activation.
NF-ATc, an inducibly expressed transcription factor, controls gene expression in T lymphocytes and cardiomyocytes.
We show here that the transcriptional co-activators CBP/p300 bind to and control the activity of the inducible N-terminal transactivation domain of NF-ATc, TAD-A.
Similar to the N terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun, TAD-A is inducibly phosphorylated, but this phosphorylation is dispensable for the interaction with CBP/p300.
Constitutive active versions of c-Raf and Rac synergistically enhance the CBP/p300-mediated increase of TAD-A activity, indicating the important role CBP/p300 plays in the integration of T cell activation signals.
Since a mutation of CBP abolishing HAT activity is almost as active as wild-type CBP in T cells, functions of CBP/p300 other than histone acetylation appear to control the NF-AT-dependent transcription in T cells.
