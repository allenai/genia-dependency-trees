Human interferon regulatory factor 2 gene.
Intron-exon organization and functional analysis of 5'-flanking region.
Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2) is a transcriptional regulatory protein that terminates interferon beta expression initiated by interferon regulatory factor 1.
In this study, we isolated the genomic DNA for human IRF-2 gene, determined the intron-exon structure of the human IRF-2 gene, mapped the major transcription initiation site, identified a number of potential regulatory elements in the 5'-flanking region, and localized the IRF-2 gene on human chromosome 4.
The IRF-2 promoter region contains a CpG island, with several GC boxes, a putative NF-kappa B-binding site, and a CAAT box, but no TATA box.
When the promoter region was linked with a heterologous reporter gene, we found that the promoter region is inducible by both interferons (interferon-alpha and -gamma) and interferon regulatory factor 1.
The region which induced these inductions was identified as being confined to 40 nucleotides 5' to the major transcriptional initiation site by testing a series of clones with truncated promoter of IRF-2.
This region contains elements which are shared with the transcriptional enhancers of other genes including interferon regulatory factor 1, interferon beta, and interferon-inducible genes.
These data suggest that interferon regulatory factor 1 not only triggers the activation of the interferon signal transduction pathway, but also may play a role in limiting the duration of this response by activating the transcription of IRF-2.
