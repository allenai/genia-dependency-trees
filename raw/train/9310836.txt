Four P-like elements are required for optimal transcription of the mouse IL-4 gene: involvement of a distinct set of nuclear factor of activated T cells and activator protein-1 family proteins.
We previously identified the P sequence as a critical regulatory element of the human IL-4 promoter.
In the mouse IL-4 promoter, there are five elements homologous to the human P sequence designated conserved lymphokine element 0 (CLE0), P, P2, P3 and P4.
To characterize the role of these P-like elements and their binding factors in the native promoter, we did transient transfection and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA).
Transfection of EL-4 cells with the IL-4 promoter-reporter constructs carrying mutated P-like elements showed that four P-like elements, CLE0, P, P2 and P4, but not P3, were required for optimal activation of the IL-4 promoter.
EMSA showed that both constitutive and inducible complexes bound to CLE0, P, P2 and P4, whereas only a constitutive complex bound to P3.
In competition and antibody supershift assays in EMSA, complexes formed with P or P2 proved to contain nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family proteins as major components.
Activator protein (AP)-1 family proteins interacted with CLE0, P, P2 and P4.
NFAT/AP-1 complex formed only with P and P2.
Cross-competition assays among the P-like elements revealed element-specific and common complexes.
Six tandem repeats of the P element linked to the SV40 promoter responded to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, while that of other elements did not.
It would thus appear that components of each P-like element-binding complexes are not identical and may coordinately contribute to transcriptional activity.
