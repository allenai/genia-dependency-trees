Isolation and characterization of murine fra-1: induction mediated by CD40 and surface Ig is protein kinase C dependent.
The murine fra-1 gene, encoding Fos-related Ag 1, was isolated from a splenic cDNA library and sequenced.
Murine fra-1 was highly homologous to rat and human fra-1.
Oligonucleotide primers based on the murine sequence were used to construct a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay for gene expression.
B lymphocyte stimulation via both CD40 and surface Ig (sIg) receptors substantially induced fra-1 expression, and for both receptors, induction was protein kinase C (PKC) dependent.
This contrasts with induction of c-fos by both CD40 and sIg, which is PKC independent and indicates that CD40 is capable of signaling through PKC or a closely related kinase.
Induction of fra-1 following engagement of CD40 did not require protein synthesis, suggesting that the PKC-dependent linkage between CD40 and fra-1 is direct.
CD40-mediated fra-1 induction did require tyrosine kinase activity.
These results demonstrate that CD40, like sIg, may employ PKC in producing select outcomes, that individual B cell receptors may signal downstream events via both PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways, and that multiple signal transduction pathways may be used to activate the expression of closely related genes.
