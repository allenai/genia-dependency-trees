Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein induces the expression of STAT1 and STAT5 genes in T-cells.
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax transforms normal T-cells in the presence of interleukin (IL)-2 in vitro.
STAT is a family of transcription factors that play a pivotal role in cytokine-induced functions of a various type of cells.
We investigated the involvement of STATs in the transformation of T-cells by HTLV-1.
HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines expressed higher amounts of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 RNA and proteins than virus-negative T cells.
The expression of STAT1 and STAT5 in a human T-cell line was induced by Tax.
IL-2 induced the DNA binding activity of STAT3 and STAT5 of a HTLV-1-transformed cell line and then stimulated its proliferation.
In contrast, IL-2 did neither in a cell line lacking STAT3 and STAT5.
The expression of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 mRNAs were also induced by a T-cell mitogen in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Our results suggest that the induction of STAT1 and STAT5 by Tax enhances cytokine-induced functions of virus-infected T-cells, hence the induction may play a role in IL-2-dependent transformation steps of T-cells by HTLV-1.
