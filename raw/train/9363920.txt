The activation of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway is commonly involved in signaling through the human IL-5 receptor.
The JAK (Janus kinase) family of protein tyrosine kinases and the STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) have been shown to be activated in response to a number of cytokines and growth factors.
In this study, we evaluated the activation of JAK/STAT pathway upon human interleukin-5 (hIL-5) stimulation of two different hIL-5-responsive cell lines, hIL-5 receptor alpha-subunit (hIL-5R alpha) cDNA-transfected TF-1 (TF-h5R alpha) and butyric-acid-treated YY-1 (YY-Bu), and peripheral eosinophils.
Immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and activation of STAT5 were induced upon stimulation with hIL-5 in all three cell types, while STAT1 activation was only observed in eosinophils.
These results indicate that JAK2/STAT5 activation is a common JAK/STAT pathway for hIL-5-mediated signal in these cells.
