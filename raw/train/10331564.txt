Expression of Th1 and Th2 type cytokines responding to HBsAg and HBxAg in chronic hepatitis B patients.
The cytokine pattern on viral antigen recognition is believed to exert a profound influence on the resolution of viral infections and viral clearance.
This study was initiated to investigate whether a cytokine imbalance oriented toward Th2 type response plays a role in chronic hepatitis B.
Cytokine profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells associated with chronic hepatitis B were analysed by RT-PCR.
Upon HBsAg stimulation, expression of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 was detected in 41%, 8%, 41%, and 50% of the patients, respectively.
Among these cytokines, the expression of IFN-gamma was associated with high levels of serum AST/ALT.
However, we could not prove that Th2 type cytokines had a protective effect on hepatocytes.
Upon HBxAg stimulation, there was no recognizable association of cytokine patterns with AST/ALT levels.
In conclusion, production of a Th1 cytokine, IFN-gamma, by HBsAg-reactive cells was associated with hepatocyte damage in chronic hepatitis B, while no counteracting effect of Th2 cytokines produced by those cells was observed.
