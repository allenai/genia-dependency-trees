Identification of human TR2 orphan receptor response element in the transcriptional initiation site of the simian virus 40 major late promoter [published erratum appears in J Biol Chem 1995 Nov 3;270(44):26721]
A DNA response element (TR2RE-SV40) for the TR2 orphan receptor, a member of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, has been identified in the simian virus 40 (SV40) +55 region (nucleotide numbers 368-389, 5'-GTTAAGGTTCGTAGGTCATGGA-3').
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay, using in vitro translated TR2 orphan receptor with a molecular mass of 67 kilodaltons, showed a specific binding with high affinity (dissociation constant = 9 nM) for this DNA sequence.
DNA-swap experiments using chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase assay demonstrated that androgen can suppress the transcriptional activities of SV40 early promoter via the interaction between this TR2RE-SV40 and the chimeric receptor AR/TR2/AR with the DNA-binding domain of the TR2 orphan receptor flanked by the N-terminal and androgen-binding domains of the androgen receptor.
In addition, this TR2RE-SV40 can function as a repressor to suppress the transcriptional activities of both SV40 early and late promoters.
Together, these data suggest the TR2RE-SV40 may represent the first identified natural DNA response element for the TR2 orphan receptor that may function as a repressor for the SV40 gene expression.
