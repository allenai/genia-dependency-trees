Quantitation of beta 1 triiodothyronine receptor mRNA in human tissues by competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
Thyroid hormones act by binding to nuclear receptor proteins, the thyroid hormone receptors (TR) alpha and beta.
Data from cell culture and animal studies indicate that TR expression may be regulated to modulate target organ responsiveness to thyroid hormone.
To investigate whether such adaptive changes in TR expression occur in humans, we determined the mRNA levels of the hTR beta 1 in various thyroid states.
Patients with overt hypo- or hyperthyroidism were enrolled in the study.
Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and hTR beta 1 mRNA levels determined by quantitative competitive reverse transcription PCR.
For comparison, hTR beta 1 mRNA levels were determined in lymphocytes and normal thyroid tissue of euthyroid patients.
Human TR beta 1 mRNA levels in lymphocytes were 1.8 +/- 0.4, 1.9 +/- 0.5, 1.1 +/- 0.4 10(-18) mol/microgram RNA in hypo-, eu- and hyperthyroid patients, respectively, corresponding to an estimated 0.5  -2 molecules per cell.
Although the mean hTR beta 1 mRNA levels were 40% lower in hyperthyroid than in euthyroid subjects, this difference did not reach statistical significance.
Similar levels of hTR beta 1 mRNA levels were detected in thyroid gland from euthyroid patients.
In summary, we developed an assay for the quantitative determination of hTR beta 1 mRNA levels in small human tissue samples, containing as little as 50 ng of total RNA.
Absolute hTR beta 1 mRNA levels are very low with an estimated one molecule of mRNA being present in a mononuclear blood cell or thyrocyte.
No up-regulation of hTR beta 1 was seen in hypothyroid relative to euthyroid patients.
However, there is a non-significant trend towards a down-regulation of hTR beta 1 mRNA levels in hyperthyroid patients.
