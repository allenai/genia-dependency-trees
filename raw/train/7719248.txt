A newly established megakaryoblastic/erythroid cell line that differentiates to red cells in the presence of erythropoietin and produces platelet-like particles.
In August, 1992, we established a leukemic cell line (NS-Meg) from a patient in megakaryoblastic transformation of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia.
The NS-Meg cells were positive for alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining and for surface CD4, CD7, CD13, CD34, CD41a, and glycophorin A antigens.
Ultrastructurally, the cells had alpha-granules, demarcation membranes, and platelet peroxidase activity.
The NS-Meg cells spontaneously produced platelet-like particles which contained alpha-granules, mitochondria and dense bodies, strongly suggesting platelet production.
Erythropoietin (Epo), granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor(GM-CSF), and interleukin 3 (IL-3) promoted the growth of NS-Meg cells.
Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate increased the expression of both CD41a and CD61 antigens.
Ten-day exposure to Epo induced mature erythroblasts and red cells.
These benzidine-positive cells were positive for hemoglobin F staining.
Untreated NS-Meg cells expressed mRNA for the Epo receptor (EpoR), for GATA-1, and for alpha 1, alpha 2 and gamma globin genes.
These results indicate that NS-Meg cells undergo terminal differentiation of both megakaryocytic and erythroid lineages.
This cell line should be a very useful tool for the investigation of both megakaryocytic and erythroid maturation.
