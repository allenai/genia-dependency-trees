CAG repeat length variation in sperm from a patient with Kennedy's disease.
Using a modified sperm typing protocol, the mutation frequency of the CAG repeat region at the androgen receptor locus has been measured using a rare semen sample from an individual with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA).
Among 258 X chromosome-containing sperm, 19% had a repeat number equal to the donor's somatic DNA (47 repeats), 66% were expansions and 15% were contractions.
The average expansion was 2.7 repeats.
More than half of the expansions involved one or two repeats; the largest was 11 repeats.
68% of the contractions were also one or two repeats but six (16%) were very large (12-25 repeats).
One contraction generated an allele in an intermediate size range (33-39 repeats).
Such alleles have not been observed among more than 900 normal and SBMA X-chromosomes that have been examined.
Comparison of the SBMA sperm typing results with mutation frequency data on normal alleles supports the hypothesis that trinucleotide repeat expansions may have a different molecular origin than contractions.
