Detection of intracellular signal transduction molecules in PBMC from rhesus macaques and sooty mangabeys.
One of the manifestations of human HIV-1 and nonhuman primate SIV infection that lead to disease is reasoned to be secondary to generalized T-cell dysfunction.
The molecular mechanisms associated with the T-cell dysfunction remain to be elucidated.
To address this issue, we sought to utilize the nonhuman primate model to study intracellular signaling events in cells from disease-susceptible rhesus macaques and disease-resistant sooty mangabeys.
Because relatively little is known about these events in nonhuman primates, our laboratory defined optimal conditions, reagents, and assays for the study of signal transduction events in cells from nonhuman primates.
The protein phosphorylation patterns in the two monkeys exhibited quantitative, qualitative, and kinetic differences.
Antibodies to Stat6 detected a unique band in macaque cell lysates.
This band is markedly decreased human cell lysates and never seen in mangabey cell lysates.
Detection of various other intracellular signaling proteins is also described.
