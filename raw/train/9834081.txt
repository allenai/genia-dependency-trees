Signaling pathways mediated by the TNF- and cytokine-receptor families target a common cis-element of the IFN regulatory factor 1 promoter.
CD40 activation of B cells is strongly influenced by the presence of cytokines.
However, the molecular basis for the interplay between these distinct stimuli is not clearly delineated.
IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor activated by either CD40 or cytokines.
We have found that these different sets of signals target a common cis-acting element in the promoter of this gene, the IRF-1 gamma-activated site (GAS).
Targeting of the IRF-1 GAS is not confined to activation via CD40 but extends to other stimuli that mimic the CD40 signaling cascade, like TNF-alpha and EBV.
In contrast to induction of STATs by cytokines, the IRF-1 GAS-binding complex activated by CD40, TNF-alpha, or EBV contains Rel proteins, specifically p50 and p65.
In this system, simultaneous exposure to CD40L together with either IL-4 or IFN-gamma does not lead to the activation of novel Rel/STAT complexes.
Given the importance of IRF-1 in a variety of biologic functions from proliferation to apoptosis, our findings support the notion that modulation of IRF-1 levels may be a critical control point in B cell activation.
