Limited proteolysis for assaying ligand binding affinities of nuclear receptors.
The binding of natural or synthetic ligands to nuclear receptors is the triggering event leading to gene transcription activation or repression.
Ligand binding to the ligand binding domain of these receptors induces conformational changes that are evidenced by an increased resistance of this domain to proteases.
In vitro labeled receptors were incubated with various synthetic or natural agonists or antagonists and submitted to trypsin digestion.
Proteolysis products were separated by SDS-PAGE and quantified.
The amount of trypsin-resistant fragments was proportional to receptor occupancy by the ligand, and allowed the determination of dissociation constants (kDa).
Using the wild-type or mutated human retinoic acid receptor alpha as a model, kDa values determined by classical competition binding assays using tritiated ligands are in agreement with those measured by the proteolytic assay.
This method was successfully extended to human retinoic X receptor alpha, glucocorticoid receptor, and progesterone receptor, thus providing a basis for a new, faster assay to determine simultaneously the affinity and conformation of receptors when bound to a given ligand.
