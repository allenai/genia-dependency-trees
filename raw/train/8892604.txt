Tyrosines 113, 128, and 145 of SLP-76 are required for optimal augmentation of NFAT promoter activity.
SLP-76 (SH2 domain leukocyte protein of 76 kDa) is a recently identified substrate of the TCR-stimulated protein tyrosine kinases that functions in the signal transduction cascade linking the TCR with IL-2 gene expression.
In this report, we demonstrate that engagement of the TCR results in tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 in its amino-terminal acidic region.
Two tyrosines (Y113 and Y128) fall within an identical five amino-acid motif and are shown to be phosphorylated upon TCR ligation.
Although mutation of either Y113 and Y128 has a minimal effect on SLP-76 function, mutation of both residues decreases significantly the ability of SLP-76 to promote T cell activation.
A third tyrosine within the amino-terminal region (Y145) appears to be the most important for optimal SLP-76 function, as altering it alone to phenylalanine has a potent impact on SLP-76 augmentation of NFAT promoter activity.
