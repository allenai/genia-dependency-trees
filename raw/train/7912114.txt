Pentoxifylline for the treatment of infection with human immunodeficiency virus.
Cytokine dysregulation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection has been documented in numerous studies and has been cited as an important component in the pathogenesis of this retroviral infection.
Pharmacological modification of cytokine dysregulation, therefore, has been suggested as a therapeutic modality for HIV-1 infection.
Dr. Dezube of Beth Israel Hospital (Boston) concisely reviews the state of our knowledge regarding the effects of pentoxifylline on expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a cytokine known to influence HIV-1 replication and to play a possible role in the clinical manifestations of advanced infection with this virus.
Pentoxifylline, a trisubstituted xanthine derivative, has been used to decrease blood viscosity and is reasonably well tolerated by most recipients of the drug.
Results of preliminary studies, many of which were conducted by Dr. Dezube, suggest that use of this agent in combination with antiretroviral compounds may prove useful in the treatment of patients with HIV-1 infection.
