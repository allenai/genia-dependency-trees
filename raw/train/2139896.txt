Human immunodeficiency virus vpr product is a virion-associated regulatory protein.
The vpr product of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) acts in trans to accelerate virus replication and cytopathic effect in T cells.
Here it is shown that the HIV-1 viral particle contains multiple copies of the vpr protein.
The vpr product is the first regulatory protein of HIV-1 to be found in the virus particle.
This observation raises the possibility that vpr acts to facilitate the early steps of infection before de novo viral protein synthesis occurs.
