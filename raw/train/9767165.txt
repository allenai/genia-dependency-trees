musculin: a murine basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene expressed in embryonic skeletal muscle.
We describe the embryonic expression of musculin, a new murine member of the bHLH family of transcription factors.
Musculin protein is closely related to human ABF-1, which is expressed in activated B cells, and to epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1, which is expressed in branchial myoblasts, visceral and urogenital mesoderm and epicardium.
In situ hybridisation revealed musculin expression in embryos was largely restricted to the embryonic skeletal muscle lineage.
While all skeletal muscles expressed the gene, only a subset of myocytes within each muscle were positive, indicating molecular heterogeneity within fetal muscle.
