[Age-related changes in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes of healthy persons and patients with hypertension]
It has been found that the number of glucocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes of the peripheral blood of healthy elderly subjects increases, while the number of mineralocorticoid receptors decreases.
The mechanisms of hormone-receptor interactions in hypertension are activated: the number of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid binding sites grows in hypertensive patients.
Still a more essential rise in the number of receptors is observed in mid-age hypertensive patients than in elderly ones.
