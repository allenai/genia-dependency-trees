The 29-kDa proteins phosphorylated in thrombin-activated human platelets are forms of the estrogen receptor-related 27-kDa heat shock protein.
Thrombin plays a critical role in platelet activation, hemostasis, and thrombosis.
Cellular activation by thrombin leads to the phosphorylation of multiple proteins, most of which are unidentified.
We have characterized several 29-kDa proteins that are rapidly phosphorylated following exposure of intact human platelets to thrombin.
A murine monoclonal antibody raised to an unidentified estrogen receptor-related 29-kDa protein selectively recognized these proteins as well as a more basic, unphosphorylated 27-kDa protein.
Cellular activation by thrombin led to a marked shift in the proportion of protein from the 27-kDa unphosphorylated form to the 29-kDa phosphoprotein species.
Using this antibody, we isolated and sequenced a human cDNA clone encoding a protein that was identical to the mammalian 27-kDa heat shock protein (HSP27), a protein of uncertain function that is known to be phosphorylated to several forms and to be transcriptionally induced by estrogen.
The 29-kDa proteins were confirmed to be phosphorylated forms of HSP27 by immunoprecipitation studies.
Thus, the "estrogen receptor-related protein" is HSP27, and the three major 29-kDa proteins phosphorylated in thrombin-activated platelets are forms of HSP27.
These data suggest a role for HSP27 in the signal transduction events of platelet activation.
