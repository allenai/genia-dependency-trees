Dopamine stimulates expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 via NF-kappaB in cells of the immune system.
Recent studies have reported that lymphocytes produce, transport and bind dopamine present in plasma.
However, the action of dopamine on HIV-1 gene expression in cells of the immune system has not yet been examined.
Here, we have investigated the regulation of HIV-1 expression by dopamine in Jurkat T cells and in primary blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
HIV-1 replication was increased by dopamine, which correlated with the increased levels of HIV-1 transactivation.
Our transient expression data revealed that dopamine stimulated transcription through the NF-kappaB element present in the long terminal repeat.
The importance of NF-kappaB sites was confirmed by using vectors containing wild-type or mutant kappaB sites in a heterologous promoter.
Consistent with the role of NF-kappaB in mediating dopamine responsiveness, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 abolished dopamine-induced transcriptional activation.
We further explored the effect of dopamine in the presence of phorbol esters or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) known to activate NF-kappaB.
The combination of dopamine and TNF-alpha led to a stimulation of HIV-1 transcription and replication.
However, in contrast with TNF-alpha, dopamine treatment did not affect NF-kappaB DNA binding activity nor the concentrations of p50, p65 and IkappaB-alpha proteins, which suggests a distinct NF-kappaB activation mechanism.
These results reveal a new link between the dopamine system, cytokine signaling pathway and regulation of gene expression via the involvement of NF-kappaB in T cells and PBMC.
