Involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in endothelial adhesion molecule induction.
Induction of endothelial adhesion molecules by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) can occur independently of protein kinase C and activation of a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) has recently been implicated in the upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) by interleukin-4 (IL-4) on endothelial cells.
We demonstrate that the PTK inhibitors herbimycin A or genistein suppress induction of endothelial VCAM-1 and E-selectin, as well as subsequent monocytic cell adhesion to endothelial cells stimulated by TNF.
Inhibition studies indicate that specific tyrosine phosphorylation following PTK activation is involved in the mobilization of the transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B, and VCAM-1 mRNA expression.
This may have implications for pathophysiological conditions that involve the upregulation of these molecules (e.g. inflammation and atherosclerosis).
