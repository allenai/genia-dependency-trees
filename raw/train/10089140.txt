Reduction of tumour necrosis factor alpha expression and signalling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia upon treatment with desferrioxamine.
Recent evidence indicates that the rate of progression of the HIV-1 disease is significantly reduced in thalassaemia major patients upon treatment with high doses of desferrioxamine (DFX).
The authors have previously demonstrated that in vitro exposure of mononuclear cells to DFX decreases the bioavailability of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) which has a stimulatory effect on HIV-1 replication.
In this study, therefore, TNF-alpha bioavailability from mononuclear cells isolated from 10 patients with thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia given DFX as compared to 10 untreated subjects has been evaluated.
Evidence is presented showing that DFX treatment reduces TNF-alpha bioavailability (P<0.05) by inhibiting its steady state (P<0.05) and by enhancing its inactivation through binding to soluble TNF-alpha receptor type II (P<0.05).
We also show that DFX treatment limits the in vivo activation of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor involved in both TNF-alpha gene transcription and TNF-alpha signalling (P<0.005).
We conclude that TNF-alpha bioavailability and signalling are impaired in patients upon DFX treatment.
This mechanism may contribute to delayed progression of the HIV-1 infection in vivo.
