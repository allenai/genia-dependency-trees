A PEBP2 alpha/AML-1-related factor increases osteocalcin promoter activity through its binding to an osteoblast-specific cis-acting element.
To identify osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors, we initiated an analysis of the promoter of a mouse osteocalcin gene, an osteoblast-specific gene.
In this promoter, we identified two osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements (Ducy, P.and Karsenty, G.(1995) Mol.Cell.Biol.15, 1858-1869).
The sequence of one of these elements, OSE2, is identical to the DNA-binding site of the PEBP2 alpha/AML-1 transcription factors, the mammalian homologues of the Drosophila Runt protein.
Here we show, using nuclear extracts, recombinant protein, and a specific antiserum against AML-1 proteins in DNA-binding assays, that one member of this family, AML-1B, binds specifically to OSE2 and is immunologically related to OSF2, the factor present in osteoblast nuclear extracts that binds to OSE2.
By DNA cotransfection experiments, we also demonstrate that AML-1B can increase the activity of a short osteocalcin promoter through its binding to OSE2.
Lastly, the different mobilities of osteoblast nuclear extract-DNA complexes compared with T-cell nuclear extract-DNA complexes, along with the inability of OSF2 to be upregulated by retinoic acid, unlike the other PEBP2 alpha factors, suggest that OSF2 is a new member of this family of transcription factors.
Thus, this study demonstrates that AML-1B can increase gene expression of an osteoblast-specific gene through its binding to an osteoblast-specific cis-acting element and presents evidence that OSF2 is a member of the PEBP2 alpha/AML-1 family of transcription factors.
