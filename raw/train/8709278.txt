The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 posttranscriptional trans-activator Rex contains a nuclear export signal.
The Rex protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 is required for the nuclear export of unspliced viral mRNA and, therefore, for virus replication.
In this manuscript, we demonstrate that Rex shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and that its activation domain constitutes a nuclear export signal that specifies efficient transport to the cytoplasm.
These findings are consistent with a model for Rex-mediated trans-activation in which Rex-viral mRNA complexes are targeted for nuclear export by the direct action of the activation domain.
