Evidence for repression of IL-2 gene activation in anergic T cells.
The induction of clonal anergy in a T cell inhibits IL-2 secretion because of the development of a proximal signal transduction defect.
Fusion of anergic murine T cells to human Jurkat T leukemia cells and formation of heterokaryons failed to result in a complementation of this signaling defect and restoration of murine IL-2 mRNA inducibility.
Instead, signal transduction to the human IL-2 gene became disrupted.
Heterokaryons formed by the fusion of anergic murine T cells to normal murine T cells also failed to accumulate intracellular IL-2 protein in response to stimulation either with the combination of CD3 and CD28 mAbs or with ionomycin plus a protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester.
The results argue against a loss-of-function signaling defect as the sole basis for clonal anergy induction and document the presence of a dominant-acting repressor molecule that inhibits signal transduction to the IL-2 gene within viable anergic T cells.
