The interleukin 2 receptor alpha chain/CD25 promoter is a target for nuclear factor of activated T cells.
The expression of the murine interleukin (IL)-2 receptor alpha chain/CD25 is strongly induced at the transcriptional level after T cell activation.
We show here that nuclear factor of activated T cell (NF-AT) factors are involved in the control of CD25 promoter induction in T cells.
NF-ATp and NF-ATc bind to two sites around positions -585 and -650 located upstream of the proximal CD25 promoter.
Immediately 3' from these NF-AT motifs, nonconsensus sites are located for the binding of AP-1-like factors.
Mutations of sites that suppress NF-AT binding impair the induction and strong NF-ATp-mediated transactivation of the CD25 promoter in T cells.
In T lymphocytes from NF-ATp-deficient mice, the expression of CD25 is severely impaired, leading to a delayed IL-2 receptor expression after T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 stimulation.
Our data indicate an important role for NF-AT in the faithful expression of high affinity IL-2 receptors and a close link between the TCR-mediated induction of IL-2 and IL-2 receptor alpha chain promoters, both of which are regulated by NF-AT factors.
