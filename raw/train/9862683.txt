The role of Stat4 in species-specific regulation of Th cell development by type I IFNs.
Type I IFNs (IFN-alpha/beta), in addition to IL-12, have been shown to play an important role in the differentiation of human, but not mouse, Th cells.
We show here that IFN-alpha/beta act directly on human T cells to drive Th1 development, bypassing the need for IL-12-induced signaling, whereas IFN-alpha cannot substitute IL-12 for mouse Th1 development.
The molecular basis for this species specificity is that IFN-alpha/beta activate Stat4 in differentiating human, but not mouse, Th cells.
Unlike IL-12, which acts only on Th1 cells, IFN-alpha/beta can activate Stat4 not only in human Th1, but also in Th2 cells.
However, restimulation of human Th2 lines and clones in the presence of IFN-alpha does not induce the production of IFN-gamma.
These results suggest that activation of Stat4, which is necessary for the differentiation of naive T cells into polarized Th1 cells, is not sufficient to induce phenotype reversal of human Th2 cells.
