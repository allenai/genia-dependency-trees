In vivo modification of major histocompatibility complex class II DRA promoter occupancy mediated by the AIR-1 trans-activator.
RJ 2.2.5 is a human B cell mutant derived from the Burkitt lymphoma Raji cell which is defective in the AIR-1 locus function.
This locus encodes a transcriptional trans-activator required for the constitutive expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes.
Here we show, by in vivo DNase I footprinting, that the AIR-1 locus defect correlates with changes in the DRA promoter occupancy.
Interestingly, reexpression of human MHC class II genes in RJ 2.2.5 x mouse spleen cell hybrids is associated with partial reversion of DRA promoter occupancy to the Raji pattern.
DRA promoter occupancy in other class II-negative B cell lines, derived from patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome, is drastically different from the one observed in RJ 2.2.5 and Raji cells.
Moreover, the use of the DNase I as an in vivo footprinting agent reveals that the patients' cell lines do not display a completely "bare promoter" as previously reported using dimethyl sulfate as the footprinting agent.
Thus, the use of DNase I allowed us, for the first time, to correlate the AIR-1 locus defect with class II promoter occupancy alterations and distinguish these alterations from the ones observed in phenotypically similar but genetically distinct MHC class II-negative cells.
