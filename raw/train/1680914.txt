Anti-CD2 receptor antibodies activate the HIV long terminal repeat in T lymphocytes.
The CD2 T lymphocyte glycoprotein surface molecule mediates both cell to cell adhesion and T cell activation, two processes that are involved in the spread of HIV infection.
Treatment of chronically HIV-infected PBMC with anti-CD2 mAb has been shown to induce the expression of infectious virus from these cultures.
In this study we investigated the mechanisms whereby anti-CD2 antibodies stimulate viral production.
We demonstrate that treatment of transiently transfected T lymphocytes with anti-CD2 antibodies results in activation of the HIV long terminal repeat.
Furthermore, CAT assays using mutated HIV long terminal repeat-CAT constructs and gel shift assays demonstrate that this activation is dependent on the NF-kappa B enhancer.
These studies suggest that interaction of CD2 with its natural ligand, LFA-3, may play a role in regulation of HIV expression.
