Involvement of Rel, Fos, and Jun proteins in binding activity to the IL-2 promoter CD28 response element/AP-1 sequence in human T cells.
CD28 is an important costimulatory molecule in the activation of human T cells.
Costimulation of T cells through both the Ag receptor and CD28 leads to high level IL-2 production, which is vital to the development of an immune response in vivo.
Previous reports have suggested the CD28 stimulation contributes to the activation of the IL-2 promoter by up-regulating the activity of several transcription factors, including AP-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)/Rel family members as well as an uncharacterized transcription factor called CD28 response complex.
While several lines of investigation have suggested that NF-kappaB/Rel family members make up the CD28 response complex transcription factor, other work has not supported this conclusion.
Recent studies suggest that the CD28 response element (CD28RE) does not function independently but works instead in conjunction with the adjacent promoter proximal AP-1-binding site and this hypothesis is confirmed here.
Also in the current study, binding activity to the CD28RE/AP-1 sequence of the IL-2 promoter is evaluated.
Although four specific complexes can be detected binding to this sequence, only one of these complexes is specific for both the CD28RE and the adjacent AP-1 site.
Of the NF-kappaB/Rel family members tested, this CD28RE/AP-1-specific complex contains predominantly c-Rel, despite the fact that both p50 and RelA can efficiently bind to the CD28RE.
c-Fos and c-Jun are also found in this CD28RE/AP-1-specific complex.
These data indicate that functional complexes encompassing both the CD28RE and the AP-1-binding sites influence IL-2 promoter activity in CD28-costimulated T cells.
