Possible role of nuclear factor-kappa B activity in germline C epsilon transcription in a human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line.
Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) plays a broad role in gene regulation, but it is not evident whether NF-kappa B acts as a messenger system for germline C epsilon transcription.
We report here that the signaling cascade triggered by interleukin-4 (IL-4) or anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb) participates in NF-kappa B activation responsible for germline C epsilon transcription in a human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line, DND39.
Both IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), translocation of a zeta isoform of protein kinase C, and nuclear expression of NF-kappa B.
All such events were abrogated by treatment with LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3-kinase.
In addition, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant, decreased NF-kappa B activation caused by IL-4, anti-CD40 mAb, or their combination.
NAC was also effective in diminishing germline C epsilon transcription, and its potency was higher in cultures costimulated with IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb than in those stimulated with IL-4 alone.
These results indicate that IL-4 and ligation of CD40 induce NF-kappa B expression via at least a mechanism dependent on the PI3-kinase pathway and suggest that NF-kappa B sensitive to NAC may play a role in regulating germline C epsilon transcription.
