MHC-peptide ligand interactions establish a functional threshold for antigen-specific T cell recognition.
Antigen-specific T cell recognition is dependent on the functional density of the TCR-ligand, which consists of specific MHC molecules and a specifically bound peptide.
We have examined the influence of the affinity and concentration of exogenous peptide and the density of specific MHC molecules on the proliferation of a CD4+, DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201 (DQ2.1)-restricted, HSV-2-specific T cell clone.
Using antigen peptide analogs with different mutations of known DQ2-anchor residues, T cell response was reduced in an peptide-affinity and - concentration specific manner.
The decrease using weaker binding peptides was gradual as stimulation with a peptide with intermediate affinity yielded intermediate T cell proliferation and the poorest binding peptide induced an even weaker T cell response.
MHC class II density on the APC was modified using DQ2 homo- and heterozygous B-LCLs as APCs, however this variation of MHC concentration had no effect on T cell proliferation.
We interpret this as a reflection of a low threshold for activation of the T cell clone, in which peptide-MHC avidity is the over-riding determinant of the strength of ligand signal.
