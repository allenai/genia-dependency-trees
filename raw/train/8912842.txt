T-cell-directed TAL-1 expression induces T-cell malignancies in transgenic mice.
The TAL-1 gene specifies for a basic domain-helix-loop-helix protein, which is involved in the control of normal hematopoiesis.
In human pathology, the TAL-1 gene product is expressed in a high percentage of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias in the pediatric age range; however, it has not been established whether the expression has a causal role in oncogenesis.
In this report, we describe the phenotype of mouse transgenic lines obtained by inducing tal-1 protein expression in lymphoid tissues using the LCK promoter.
The survival rate of tal-1 transgenic animals was much lower as compared with control mice.
Histopathological analysis revealed lymphomas of T-cell type, often comprising a minor B-cell component.
Some mice showed marked splenic lymphocyte depletion.
Primary lymphocyte cultures showed partial independence from exogenous growth stimuli and increased resistance to low-serum apoptosis.
To further unravel the tal-1 oncogenic potential, a strain of tal-1 transgenic mice was crossbred with p53-/- mice; the survival rate in these animals was reduced by more than one-half when compared with that of tal-1 mice, and histopathological analysis revealed exclusively T-cell lymphomas.
These data indicate that TAL-1, expressed in T cells, is per se a potent oncogene, which may exert a key leukemogenetic role in the majority of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias.
