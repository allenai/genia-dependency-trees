Interleukin-10 stabilizes inhibitory kappaB-alpha in human monocytes.
Interleukin-10 (IL-10) protects animals from lethal endotoxemia.
This beneficial effect is mediated, in part, by inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).
Evidence suggests that IL-10 may inhibit activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) through an unknown mechanism.
NF-kappaB activation in response to inflammatory signals is dependent upon degradation of its associated inhibitory peptide, inhibitory kappaB-alpha (IkappaB-alpha).
We hypothesized that IL-10 prevents human monocyte NF-kappaB activation and resultant TNF-alpha production by stabilization of IkappaB-alpha.
The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of IL-10 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human monocyte TNF-alpha production, NF-kappaB activation, and IkappaB-alpha degradation.
Monocytes were isolated from human donors.
Cells were stimulated with endotoxin (LPS, 100 ng/mL) with and without human IL-10 (10 ng/mL).
Following stimulation, TNF-alpha was measured in cell supernatants by ELISA, NF-kappaB activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and IkappaB-alpha levels by Western blot.
We observed that after LPS stimulation of human monocytes, TNF-alpha increased to 798+/-67 pg/mL (p < .001 versus control).
IL-10 attenuated LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha production (297+/-54; p < .001 versus LPS alone).
After LPS stimulation in human monocytes, IkappaB-alpha protein levels decreased, and NF-kappaB DNA binding increased.
IL-10 pretreatment prevented LPS-induced decreases in IkappaB-alpha protein levels and attenuated NF-kappaB DNA binding.
IL-10 appears to prevent activation of NF-kappaB by preserving IkappaB-alpha protein levels, leading to a reduction in TNF-alpha release.
