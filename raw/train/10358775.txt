Selection of the T cell repertoire.
Advances in gene technology have allowed the manipulation of molecular interactions that shape the T cell repertoire.
Although recognized as fundamental aspects of T lymphocyte development, only recently have the mechanisms governing positive and negative selection been examined at a molecular level.
Positive selection refers to the active process of rescuing MHC-restricted thymocytes from programmed cell death.
Negative selection refers to the deletion or inactivation of potentially autoreactive thymocytes.
This review focuses on interactions during thymocyte maturation that define the T cell repertoire, with an emphasis placed on current literature within this field.
