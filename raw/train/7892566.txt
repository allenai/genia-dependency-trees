[Regulation of transcription of the interleukin-2 gene in B-lymphocytes]
Since most B cell clones immortalized with EBV virus can be induced to produce interleukin-2, a typical T cell cytokine, we studied the role of different elements of the IL-2 promoter in such clones by transfection.
It was found, in particular, that the element TCEd, which binds the transcription factor NF-kB, is very active in all three B clones tested.
This element has no activity in T cells of the Jurkat line.
The NFATd element, which binds the transcription factor NFAT-1 and is very active in T cells, is only weakly active in one B clone and not at all in another.
Different elements thus contribute to IL-2 promoter activity in different cells.
