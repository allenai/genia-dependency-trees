p130, p107, and pRb are differentially regulated in proliferating cells and during cell cycle arrest by alpha-interferon.
We have determined how the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma family (pRb, p107, and p130) is governed in individual cell cycle phases of Daudi B-cells during cell cycle exit triggered by alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN).
alpha-IFN causes dephosphorylation of pRb and loss of p130 phosphorylated Form 3.
However, the change in p130 phosphorylation in response to alpha-IFN occurs before dephosphorylation of pRb is complete because loss of p130 Form 3 occurs throughout the cell cycle prior to complete arrest in G1, whereas pRb is dephosphorylated only in G1.
In contrast, p107 is dephosphorylated and is then depleted from cells as they exit the cell cycle.
p130, predominantly in Form 1, and hypophosphorylated pRb bind an E2F DNA binding site; p130 complexes E2F-4, whereas pRb binds both E2F-4 and E2F-1.
The phosphorylated forms of E2F-4 that bind to the E2F DNA site are different from hyperphosphorylated E2F-4, which predominates in primary hemopoietic cells in G0.
We conclude that although cell cycle arrest induced by alpha-IFN may be mediated in part by formation of a complex containing p130 and E2F-4, alpha-IFN does not induce hyperphosphorylation of E2F-4, which characterizes primary hemopoietic cells in G0.
