Heterogeneity of clonal development in chronic myeloproliferative disorders.
Recent reports have suggested a previously unexpected variability in the expression of the dominant neoplastic clone in myeloproliferative disorders (MPD).
We evaluated 49 female patients with MPD and informative at the X-linked androgen receptor (AR) locus to establish the X chromosome inactivation pattern of hemopoietic cells.
Whereas in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) the granulocytes (PMN) were uniformly of monoclonal origin, a striking heterogeneity of clonal development was found in PMN from patients with other MPD, with up to 50% of them expressing a polyclonal pattern of X inactivation.
