An interleukin-4-induced transcription factor: IL-4 Stat.
Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is an immunomodulatory cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes, basophils, and mast cells.
It plays an important role in modulating the balance of T helper (Th) cell subsets, favoring expansion of the Th2 lineage relative to Th1.
Imbalance of these T lymphocyte subsets has been implicated in immunological diseases including allergy, inflammation, and autoimmune disease.
IL-4 may mediate its biological effects, at least in part, by activating a tyrosine-phosphorylated DNA binding protein.
This protein has now been purified and its encoding gene cloned.
Examination of the primary amino acid sequence of this protein indicates that it is a member of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) family of DNA binding proteins, hereby designated IL-4 Stat.
Study of the inhibitory activities of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides derived from the intracellular domain of the IL-4 receptor provided evidence for direct coupling of receptor and transcription factor during the IL-4 Stat activation cycle.
Such observations indicate that IL-4 Stat has the same functional domain for both receptor coupling and dimerization.
