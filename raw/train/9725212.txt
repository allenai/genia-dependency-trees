Protein kinase C regulates Fas (CD95/APO-1) expression.
Fas (CD95/APO-1) is a transmembrane protein of the TNF/neuron growth factor receptor family.
Ligation of Fas by specific Abs or Fas ligand (FasL/CD95 ligand) induces rapid apoptotic cell death in a variety of cell types.
Despite progress in understanding the death signals transduced from Fas, very little is known with regard to the mechanisms by which Fas expression is regulated.
Using our previously established murine T cell hybridoma model A1.1, we show that specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors could block activation-induced Fas expression and apoptosis.
The activation of PKC with PMA or 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol could mimic the TCR signal by inducing the expression of Fas but not FasL.
PKC-dependent Fas expression was also observed in several murine and human tumor cell lines.
Since the inhibition of Ca2+ redistribution by an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, 8-(diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride, inhibited TCR-induced FasL but not Fas, the expression of Fas appears to be independent of Ca2+ mobilization.
Significantly, expression of the newly identified Fas-regulatory gene, TDAG51, was found to be dependent upon the activity of PKC.
PKC activation only induced Fas expression in cells expressing wild-type TDAG51.
Thus, Fas expression is likely mediated by PKC through TDAG51.
