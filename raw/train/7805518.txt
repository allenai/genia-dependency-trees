[The changes in glucocorticoid receptors in peripheral leukocytes in asthmatic subjects]
The number of glucocorticoid receptors (GCR) in peripheral leukocytes was determined by radioligand-binding assay in extrinsic and intrinsic asthmatics.
Their corresponding plasma cortisol levels were assessed.
The results showed that the average number of GCR in asthmatics was significantly lower than that in healthy subjects (P < 0.01), and there was a linear correlation between the number of GCR and the course of asthma.
Besides, there was also a linear correlation between the number of GCR and the age of the initial attack of asthma.
No difference in plasma cortisol level was found between asthmatics and healthy subjects.
These findings suggest that there is no primary and general impairment of glucocorticoid metabolism in the asthmatics, but the number of GCR in the asthmatics is lower than that in healthy controls.
The decrease of the number of GCR in asthmatics, we think, is related to heredity and repeated attacks of asthma.
