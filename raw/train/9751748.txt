BCL-6 mutations in normal germinal center B cells: evidence of somatic hypermutation acting outside Ig loci.
The molecular mechanism involved in the process of antigen-driven somatic hypermutation of Ig genes is unknown, but it is commonly believed that this mechanism is restricted to the Ig loci.
B cell lymphomas commonly display multiple somatic mutations clustering in the 5'-regulatory region of BCL-6, a proto-oncogene encoding for a POZ/Zinc finger transcriptional repressor expressed in germinal center (GC) B cells and required for GC formation.
To determine whether BCL-6 mutations represent a tumor-associated phenomenon or reflect a physiologic mechanism, we screened single human tonsillar GC B cells for mutations occurring in the BCL-6 5'-noncoding region and in the Ig variable heavy chain sequences.
Thirty percent of GC B cells, but not naive B cells, displayed mutations in the 742 bp region analyzed within the first intron of BCL-6 (overall frequency: 5 x 10(-4)/bp).
Accordingly, an expanded survey in lymphoid malignancies showed that BCL-6 mutations are restricted to B cell tumors displaying GC or post-GC phenotype and carrying mutated Ig variable heavy chain sequences.
These results indicate that the somatic hypermutation mechanism active in GC B cells physiologically targets non-Ig sequences.
