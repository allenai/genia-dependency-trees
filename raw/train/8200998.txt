Prenatal immune challenge alters the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in adult rats.
We investigated whether non-abortive maternal infections would compromise fetal brain development and alter hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis functioning when adult.
To study putative teratogenic effects of a T cell-mediated immune response versus an endotoxic challenge, 10-d-pregnant rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of 5 x 10(8) human red blood cells (HRBC) or gram-negative bacterial endotoxin (Escherichia coli LPS: 30 micrograms/kg).
The adult male progeny (3 mo old) of both experimental groups showed increased basal plasma corticosterone levels.
In addition, after novelty stress the HRBC group, but not the LPS group, showed increased ACTH and corticosterone levels.
Both groups showed substantial decreases in mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels in the hippocampus, a limbic brain structure critical for HPA axis regulation, whereas GR concentrations in the hypothalamus were unchanged and in anterior pituitary were slightly increased.
HRBC and LPS indeed stimulated the maternal immune system as revealed by specific anti-HRBC antibody production and enhanced IL-1 beta mRNA expression in splenocytes, respectively.
This study demonstrates that a T cell-mediated immune response as well as an endotoxic challenge during pregnancy can induce anomalies in HPA axis function in adulthood.
Clinically, it may be postulated that disturbed fetal brain development due to prenatal immune challenge increases the vulnerability to develop mental illness involving inadequate responses to stress.
