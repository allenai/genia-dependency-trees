Natural variants of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat: analysis of promoters with duplicated DNA regulatory motifs.
Sequence variation in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region of HIV-1 was analyzed in viral isolates of 17 infected individuals.
Two classes of LTR size variants were found.
One HIV-1 variant was detected containing an additional binding site for the transcription factor Sp1.
Another LTR size variation was observed in four patients in a region just upstream of the NF-kappa B enhancer.
This variation was the result of a duplication of a short DNA sequence (CTG-motif).
Cell culture experiments demonstrated that the natural variant with four Sp1 sites had a slightly higher promoter activity and viral replication rate than the isogenic control LTR with three Sp1 sites.
No positive effect of the duplicated CTG-motif could be detected.
In order to measure small differences in virus production more accurately, equal amounts of a size variant and the wild-type plasmid were cotransfected into T-cells.
The virus with four Sp1 sites did outgrow the three Sp1 virus in 35 days of culture and CTG-monomer virus outcompeted the CTG-dimer virus in 42 days.
Based on these results we estimate a 5-10% difference in virus production of the LTR variants when compared to that of wild-type.
