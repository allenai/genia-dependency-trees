Alternative polyadenylation events contribute to the induction of NF-ATc in effector T cells.
The transcription factor NF-ATc is synthesized in three prominent isoforms.
These differ in the length of their C terminal peptides and mode of synthesis.
Due to a switch from the use of a 3' polyA site to a more proximal polyA site, NF-ATc expression switches from the synthesis of the two longer isoforms in naive T cells to that of short isoform A in T effector cells.
The relative low binding affinity of cleavage stimulation factor CstF-64 to the proximal polyA site seems to contribute to its neglect in naive T cells.
These alternative polyadenylation events ensure the rapid accumulation of high concentrations of NF-ATc necessary to exceed critical threshold levels of NF-ATc for gene induction in effector T cells.
