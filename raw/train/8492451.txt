[The trend of molecular biology study on eosinophils]
Recently, many investigators have been interested in the study on eosinophil biology since genes association with eosinophils such as interleukin-5 or eosinophil granule proteins (EPO, ECP, EDN, MBP, and CLC), were isolated.
However, the molecular basis for the commitment of progenitors to the eosinophil lineage has not been determined.
The mechanism by which eosinophil-specific genes encoding primary and secondary granule proteins (e.g. ECP, EDN, EPO, MBP, and CLC) are expressed and regulated during eosinophilopoiesis is also unknown.
In this paper, I described the characterization of genes encoding eosinophil granule proteins and the mRNA expression of GATA-1 binding transcription factor during eosinophil differentiation.
