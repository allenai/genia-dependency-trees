Estrogen binding sites in peripheral blood monocytes and effects of danazol on their sites in vitro.
1. This study was designed to investigate the presence of estrogen type I (high affinity, low capacity) and type II (low affinity, high capacity) binding sites in human peripheral blood monocytes and the effects of danazol on these sites.
2. These two types of estrogen binding sites existed in human peripheral blood monocytes.
3. Danazol bound to these sites in high concentration (10(-6) M, clinical serum concentration during danazol therapy) and decreased the number of both sites.
4. It is suggested that danazol has an anti-estrogenic action to the monocytes through the competition and suppression of estrogen binding sites as seen in the estrogen target organ.
