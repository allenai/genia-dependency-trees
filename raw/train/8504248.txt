Regulation of the beta-globin locus.
Transcription of the human beta-globin gene cluster depends upon upstream regulatory sequences, which are collectively termed the locus control region.
Recent studies have provided new insights into how the individual genes of the cluster are regulated through development.
The crux of transcriptional activation is how the locus control region communicates with the gene-proximal regulatory elements.
