T cell-specific negative regulation of transcription of the human cytokine IL-4.
IL-4 secreted by activated T cells is a pleiotropic cytokine affecting growth and differentiation of diverse cell types such as T cells, B cells, and mast cells.
We investigated the upstream regulatory elements of the human IL-4 promoter.
A novel T cell-specific negative regulatory element (NRE) composed of two protein-binding sites were mapped in the 5' flanking region of the IL-4 gene: -311CTCCCTTCT-303 (NRE-I) and -288CTTTTTGCTT-TGC-300 (NRE-II).
A T cell-specific protein Neg-1 and a ubiquitous protein Neg-2 binding to NRE-I and NRE-II, respectively, were identified.
Furthermore, a positive regulatory element was found 45 bp downstream of the NRE.
The enhancer activity of the PRE was completely suppressed when the NRE was present.
These data suggest that IL-4 promoter activity is normally down-regulated by an NRE via repression of the enhancer positive regulatory element.
These data may have implications for the stringent control of IL-4 expression in T cells.
