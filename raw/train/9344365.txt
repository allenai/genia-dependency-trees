Suppression of nuclear factor kappa B and CD18-mediated leukocyte adhesion to the corneal endothelium by dexamethasone.
PURPOSE: To demonstrate that leukocyte adhesion to cultured corneal endothelial cells is mediated by the CD18 antigen, and to determine whether dexamethasone directly suppresses adhesion by inhibiting activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB).
METHODS: Cultured bovine corneal endothelium was stimulated for 6 hours by 40 micron/ml tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha).
Dexamethasone was added 1 hour before TNFalpha stimulation in the dexamethasone group.
After stimulation, neutrophils separated from a healthy human volunteer were added with or without anti-CD18 antibody.
The culture plate was settled for 15 minutes at 37 degrees C, and then neutrophils were activated by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine for 5 minutes.
Nonadherent neutrophils were removed by sealing and inverting the culture well.
The intracellular localization of NFkappaB after TNFalpha simulation was determined by confocal immunocytochemistry using an anti-p65 antibody.
RESULTS: Neutrophil adhesion to cultured corneal endothelial cells increased significantly on exposure to TNFalpha (451.4+/-45.4 cells/mm2, n = 16) compared to control (156.7+/-27.3 cells/mm2, n = 16, P < 0.01).
This increased adhesion was suppressed by the addition of anti-CD18 antibody (157.6+/-25.1 cells/mm2, n = 8, P < 0.01) and by pretreatment with 10(-7) M dexamethasone (207.9+/-31.5 cells/mm2, n = 10, P < 0.01).
Immunocytochemistry 60 minutes after stimulation revealed that NFkappaB was located in the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells; however, the addition of TNFalpha caused NFkappaB to translocate into the nucleus.
Pretreatment with dexamethasone tapered NFkappaB translocation into the nucleus.
CONCLUSIONS: Leukocyte adhesion to the corneal endothelium was shown to be mediated by CD18 expressed on activated leukocytes.
Pretreatment of the endothelium with dexamethasone inhibited leukocyte adhesion; this may be due in part to the suppression of NFkappaB entry into the nucleus.
