Selection and long-term persistence of reactive CTL clones during an EBV chronic response are determined by avidity, CD8 variable contribution compensating for differences in TCR affinities.
Recent studies have suggested that the diversity of TCR repertoire after primary immunization is conserved in memory T cells and that a progressive narrowing of this repertoire may take place during recall infections.
It now remains to be investigated which parameters determine the repertoire of the memory response and possibly restrict its diversity after subsequent antigenic challenges.
To address this question, we took advantage of a panel of CD8+ T cell clones from the joint of a rheumatoid arthritis patient and selected for their reactivity against a single MHC/peptide complex.
Characterization of both TCR chains documented a great diversity among those clones and the persistence of clonotypes over a 2-yr period.
Strikingly, despite the observed repertoire heterogeneity, all clones displayed a narrow range of MHC/peptide density requirements in cytotoxicity assays (ED50 between 9 and 36 nM).
TCR affinities were then indirectly estimated by blocking CD8 interaction with an anti-CD8 mAb.
We found a wide range of TCR affinities among the different clonotypes that segregated with Vbeta usage.
We thus propose that during an in vivo chronic response, a narrow range of avidity of the TCR-CD8 complex conditions long-term clonotype persistence, and that the level of CD8 contribution is adjusted to keep clonotypes with variable TCR affinities within this avidity window.
