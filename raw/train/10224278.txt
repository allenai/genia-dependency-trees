Grf40, A novel Grb2 family member, is involved in T cell signaling through interaction with SLP-76 and LAT.
We molecularly cloned a new Grb2 family member, named Grf40, containing the common SH3-SH2-SH3 motif.
Expression of Grf40 is predominant in hematopoietic cells, particularly T cells.
Grf40 binds to the SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD (SLP-76) via its SH3 domain more tightly than Grb2.
Incidentally, Grf40 binds to linker for activation of T cells (LAT) possibly via its SH2 domain.
Overexpression of wild-type Grf40 in Jurkat cells induced a significant increase of SLP-76-dependent interleukin (IL)-2 promoter and nuclear factor of activated T cell (NF-AT) activation upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, whereas the COOH-terminal SH3-deleted Grf40 mutant lacked any recognizable increase in IL-2 promoter activity.
Furthermore, the SH2-deleted Grf40 mutant led to a marked inhibition of these regulatory activities, the effect of which is apparently stronger than that of the SH2-deleted Grb2 mutant.
Our data suggest that Grf40 is an adaptor molecule involved in TCR-mediated signaling through a more efficient interaction than Grb2 with SLP-76 and LAT.
