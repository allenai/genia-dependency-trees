A factor that regulates the class II major histocompatibility complex gene DPA is a member of a subfamily of zinc finger proteins that includes a Drosophila developmental control protein.
A novel DNA sequence element termed the J element involved in the regulated expression of class II major histocompatibility complex genes was recently described.
To study this element and its role in class II gene regulation further, a cDNA library was screened with oligonucleotide probes containing both the S element and the nearby J element of the human DPA gene.
Several DNA clones were obtained by this procedure, one of which, clone 18, is reported and characterized here.
It encodes a protein predicted to contain 688 amino acid residues, including 11 zinc finger motifs of the C2H2 type in the C-terminal region, that are Kruppel-like in the conservation of the H/C link sequence connecting them.
The 160 N-terminal amino acids in the nonfinger region of clone 18 are highly homologous with similar regions of several other human, mouse, and Drosophila sequences, defining a subfamily of Kruppel-like zinc finger proteins termed TAB (tramtrack [ttk]-associated box) here.
One of the Drosophila sequences, ttk, is a developmental control gene, while a second does not contain a zinc finger region but encodes a structure important in oocyte development.
An acidic activation domain is located between the N-terminal conserved region of clone 18 and its zinc fingers.
This protein appears to require both the S and J elements, which are separated by 10 bp for optimal binding.
Antisense cDNA to clone 18 inhibited the expression of a reporter construct containing the DPA promoter, indicating its functional importance in the expression of this class II gene.
