Bcl-2: a repressor of lymphocyte death.
The genes and mechanisms that control programmed cell death are currently the subject of intense study.
The bcl-2 gene, a repressor of lymphocyte death, is perhaps the best understood of the programmed cell death associated genes.
Here, Stanley Korsmeyer provides a brief overview of bcl-2, concentrating on its roles in B- and T-cell development and in oncogenesis.
