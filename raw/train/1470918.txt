Targeted degradation of c-Fos, but not v-Fos, by a phosphorylation-dependent signal on c-Jun.
The proto-oncogene products c-Fos and c-Jun heterodimerize through their leucine zippers to form the AP-1 transcription factor.
The transcriptional activity of the heterodimer is regulated by signal-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events.
The stability of c-Fos was found to also be controlled by intracellular signal transduction.
In transient expression and in vitro degradation experiments, the stability of c-Fos was decreased when the protein was dimerized with phosphorylated c-Jun.
c-Jun protein isolated from phorbol ester-induced cells did not target c-Fos for degradation, which suggests that c-Fos is transiently stabilized after stimulation of cell growth.
v-Fos protein, the retroviral counterpart of c-Fos, was not susceptible to degradation targeted by c-Jun.
