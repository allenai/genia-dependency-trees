Transcriptional regulation of lysosomal acid lipase in differentiating monocytes is mediated by transcription factors Sp1 and AP-2.
Human lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) is a hydrolase required for the cleavage of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides derived from plasma lipoproteins.
It is shown here that during monocyte to macrophage differentiation, the expression of LAL-mRNA is induced.
This induction is dependent on protein kinase C activity and protein synthesis.
The cell type-specific increase in LAL expression is further investigated in the THP-1 cell line with respect to transcriptional regulation.
The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 differentiates into macrophage-like cells when treated with phorbol esters.
In order to determine the cis-acting elements necessary for both basal and phorbol 12-myristate-13 acetate (PMA)-enhanced promoter activity, we performed deletion analysis and reporter gene assays.
A PMA responsive element has been identified between -182 bp and -107 bp upstream of the major transcription start site.
Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that binding of Sp1 and AP-2 to the LAL promoter is increased by PMA in THP-1 cells.
Co-transfections with expression plasmids for Sp1 and AP-2 further emphasized the important role of these transcription factors in both basal and PMA-enhanced LAL expression.
Our data suggest that differentiation dependent increase of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) expression in THP-1 cells is mediated by a concerted action of Sp1 and AP-2.
