Danazol decreases transcription of estrogen receptor gene in human monocytes.
1. Administration of danazol for over one month reduced the levels of estrogen receptor (ER) and its mRNA to approximately 50 and 20%, respectively in monocytes.
2. Danazol did not alter the degradation rate of ER mRNA in monocytes.
3. Danazol decreased the transcription rate of ER gene to approximately 50% in monocytes in a run-on assay.
4. Danazol may release estrogen predominance via the reduction of transcription for ER gene, which leads to the reduction of ER mRNA and ER expressions in monocytes.
