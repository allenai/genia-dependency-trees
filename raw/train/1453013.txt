SCL and related hemopoietic helix-loop-helix transcription factors.
The helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins are a family of transcription factors that include proteins critical to differentiation and development in species ranging from plants to mammals.
Five members of this family (MYC, SCL, TAL-2, LYL-1 and E2A) are implicated in oncogenic events in human lymphoid tumors because of their consistent involvement in chromosomal translocations.
Although activated in T cell leukemias, expression of SCL and LYL-1 is low or undetectable in normal T cell populations.
SCL is expressed in erythroid, megakaryocyte and mast cell populations (the same cell lineages as GATA-1, a zinc-finger transcription factor).
In addition, both SCL and GATA-1 undergo coordinate modulation during chemically induced erythroid differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells and are down-modulated during myeloid differentiation of human K562 cells, thus implying a role for SCL in erythroid differentiation events.
However, in contrast to GATA-1, SCL is expressed in the developing brain.
Studies of the function of SCL suggest it is also important in proliferation and self-renewal events in erythroid cells.
