Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein-1 triggers AP-1 activity via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase cascade.
The Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) is an integral membrane protein which transforms fibroblasts and is essential for EBV-mediated B-cell immortalization.
LMP-1 has been shown to trigger cellular NF-kappa B activity which, however, cannot fully explain the oncogenic potential of LMP-1.
Here we show that LMP-1 induces the activity of the AP-1 transcription factor, a dimer of Jun/Jun or Jun/Fos proteins.
LMP-1 effects on AP-1 are mediated through activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade, but not the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathway.
Consequently, LMP-1 triggers the activity of the c-Jun N-terminal transactivation domain which is known to be activated upon JNK-mediated phosphorylation.
Deletion analysis indicates that the 55 C-terminal amino acids of the LMP-1 molecule, but not its TRAF interaction domain, are essential for AP-1 activation.
JNK-mediated transcriptional activation of AP-1 is the direct output of LMP-1-triggered signaling, as shown by an inducible LMP-1 mutant.
Using a tetracycline-regulated LMP-1 allele, we demonstrate that JNK is also an effector of non-cytotoxic LMP-1 signaling in B cells, the physiological target cells of EBV.
In summary, our data reveal a novel effector of LMP-1, the SEK/JNK/c-Jun/AP-1 pathway, which contributes to our understanding of the immortalizing and transforming potential of LMP-1.
