An 11-base-pair DNA sequence motif apparently unique to the human interleukin 4 gene confers responsiveness to T-cell activation signals.
We have identified a DNA segment that confers responsiveness to antigen stimulation signals on the human interleukin (IL) 4 gene in Jurkat cells.
The human IL-4 gene, of 10 kilobases, is composed of four exons and three introns.
A cis-acting element (P sequence) resides in the 5' upstream region; no additional DNA segments with enhancer activity were identified in the human IL-4 gene.
For further mapping purposes, a fusion promoter was constructed with the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor basic promoter containing 60 base pairs of sequence upstream from the cap site of the mouse granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene and various lengths of the 5' upstream sequence of the IL-4 gene.
The P sequence was located between positions -79 and -69 relative to the transcription start site of the human IL-4 gene, and this location was confirmed by base-substitution mutations.
The plasmids carrying multiple copies of the P sequence showed higher responsiveness to the stimulation.
The binding protein(s) that recognize the P sequence of the IL-4 gene were identified by DNA-mobility-shift assays.
The binding of NF(P) (a DNA binding protein that specifically recognizes the P sequence) to the P sequence was abolished when oligonucleotides carrying base substitutions were used, indicating that the NF(P) interaction is sequence-specific and that binding specificity of the protein paralleled the sequence requirements for IL-4 expression in vivo.
The P sequence does not share homology with the 5' upstream sequence of the IL-2 gene, even though surrounding sequences of the IL-4 gene share high homology with the IL-2 gene.
We conclude that a different set of proteins recognize IL-2 and IL-4 genes.
