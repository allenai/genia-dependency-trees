Requirement of GATA-1 and p45 NF-E2 expression in butyric acid-induced erythroid differentiation.
Butyric acid (BA) is known to induce overexpression of fetal hemoglobin and then erythroid differentiation.
Therefore, BA is currently under clinical investigation as a potential therapy for the treatment of sickle cell disease and cancer.
Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in BA-induced differentiation remain largely unknown.
Previous reports have shown that BA-induced overexpression of erythroid genes occurred at the transcriptional level, suggesting the involvement of erythroid transcription factors.
Here, we intend to demonstrate the requirement of GATA-1 and NF-E2 transcription factors in the BA-induced erythroid differentiation of human leukemic K562 cells.
Time-course experiments showed that nuclear levels of GATA-1 and p45 NF-E2 proteins increased during BA treatment.
Moreover, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting either GATA-1 or p45 NF-E2 proteins inhibited both protein expression and BA-induced differentiation.
In contrast, BA-induced cell growth inhibition was not affected.
These results provide the first direct evidence for the requirement of GATA-1 and NF-E2 in BA-induced differentiation process.
