The C-terminus of the B cell activator Oct-2 functions as an activation domain in yeast.
Oct-1 and Oct-2 are human transcriptional activators that bind to the same DNA element but activate distinct sets of genes.
We expressed these factors in S. cerevisiae and observed greater than 5-fold stimulation of a lacZ reporter gene only with Oct-2.
Transfer of the Oct-2 C-terminal domain onto either Oct-1 (Oct1.2) or a nonactivating DNA-binding domain from GAL4 created activators capable of greater than 15 and 10-fold stimulation of activity, respectively.
Thus, the C-terminus of Oct-2 is sufficient to confer activation potential to nonactive DNA-binding fragments in yeast.
