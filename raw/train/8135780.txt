Calcineurin activates transcription from the GM-CSF promoter in synergy with either protein kinase C or NF-kappa B/AP-1 in T cells.
Two cis-acting elements GM-kappa B/GC-box and CLE0, of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene are required for maximal induction in Jurkat T cells by costimulation with phorbol-12-myristate acetate (PMA) and Ca2+ ionophore (A23187).
The GM-kappa B sequence is recognized by NF-kappa B, which is mainly induced by PMA.
The CLE0 sequence interacts with factors, related to a PMA-induced AP-1 and a PMA/A23187-induced NF-AT.
We examined whether signal transducing components in T cells can activate transcription of the GM-CSF gene.
Cotransfection of NF-kappa B (p50/p65)- or AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos)- expression vectors into Jurkat cells with a luciferase reporter containing the GM-CSF promoter did not stimulate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter.
In contrast, cotransfection with a combination of NF-kappa B and AP-1 significantly augmented transcription from the GM-CSF promoter containing the GM-kappa B/GC-box and the CLE0 (AP-1/NF-AT).
Expression of a constitutively active calcineurin (CN), a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, potentiated by two fold the transcriptional activation by NF-kappa B/AP-1.
Both constitutively active forms of CN and protein kinase C (PKC) synergistically activated transcription from the GM-CSF promoter.
These results suggest that cooperation among NF-kappa B-, AP-1- and NF-AT-binding sequences is required for induction of the GM-CSF gene through PKC- and Ca2+- signaling pathways downstream of T cell activation.
