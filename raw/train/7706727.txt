cDNA cloning of a NGFI-B/nur77-related transcription factor from an apoptotic human T cell line.
A human T lymphoid cell line, PEER, dies by apoptosis in the presence of PMA and calcium ionophore.
A new gene, TINUR, was cloned from apoptotic PEER cells.
The expression of the TINUR gene is induced within 1 h after the cross-linking of the T cell Ag receptor complex.
TINUR belongs to the NGFI-B/nur77 family of the steroid receptor superfamily and is an orphan receptor.
TINUR binds to the same DNA sequence as NGFI-B/nur77.
We also propose that the NGFI-B/nur77 family can be classified into two subtypes.
