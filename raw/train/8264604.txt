The macrophage transcription factor PU.1 directs tissue-specific expression of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor.
The macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor is expressed in a tissue-specific fashion from two distinct promoters in monocytes/macrophages and the placenta.
In order to further understand the transcription factors which play a role in the commitment of multipotential progenitors to the monocyte/macrophage lineage, we have initiated an investigation of the factors which activate the M-CSF receptor very early during the monocyte differentiation process.
Here we demonstrate that the human monocytic M-CSF receptor promoter directs reporter gene activity in a tissue-specific fashion.
Since one of the few transcription factors which have been implicated in the regulation of monocyte genes is the macrophage- and B-cell-specific PU.1 transcription factor, we investigated whether PU.1 binds and activates the M-CSF receptor promoter.
Here we demonstrate that both in vitro-translated PU.1 and PU.1 from nuclear extracts bind to a specific site in the M-CSF receptor promoter just upstream from the major transcription initiation site.
Mutations in this site which eliminate PU.1 binding decrease M-CSF receptor promoter activity significantly in macrophage cell lines only.
Furthermore, PU.1 transactivates the M-CSF receptor promoter in nonmacrophage cells.
These results suggest that PU.1 plays a major role in macrophage gene regulation and development by directing the expression of a receptor for a key macrophage growth factor.
