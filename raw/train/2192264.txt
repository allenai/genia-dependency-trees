Involvement of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in the signal transduction pathway for interleukin-1.
Expression of a highly specific protein inhibitor for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in interleukin-1 (IL-1)-responsive cells blocked IL-1-induced gene transcription that was driven by the kappa immunoglobulin enhancer or the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat.
This inhibitor did not affect protein kinase C-mediated gene transcription, suggesting that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases are involved in the signal transduction pathway for IL-1 in a number of responsive cell types.
