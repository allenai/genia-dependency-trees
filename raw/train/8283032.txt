Increased proliferation, cytotoxicity, and gene expression after stimulation of human peripheral blood T lymphocytes through a surface ganglioside (GD3) [published erratum appears in J Immunol 1994 Jul 15;153(2):910]
Previous studies have suggested that gangliosides have an important role in cell signaling and recognition.
However, their specific function in these processes has not been clearly defined.
A mAb, R24, that reacts specifically with a cell surface ganglioside (GD3) has been demonstrated to stimulate proliferation of T cells derived from human peripheral blood.
In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which the R24 mAb affects T cell functions.
We have observed that the R24 mAb stimulates GD3+ T cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, and surface marker expression of IL-2R alpha-chain, IL-2R beta-chain, HLA-DR, CD11a, and CD11c.
Additionally, IFN-gamma activity but not IL-1, IL-2, or IL-4 activity was present in culture supernatants 72 h after R24 stimulation.
In some donors, increased IL-6 and TNF-alpha activity also was detected after R24 treatment.
Furthermore, R24 treatment resulted in translocation of c-rel, but little or no NF kappa B p50 or p65, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and an increase of NF kappa B binding complexes containing c-rel and p50.
This treatment also caused increased tyrosine phosphorylation of specific protein substrates.
R24-stimulated increases in proliferation, cytotoxicity, and cell surface protein expression could be blocked by cyclosporin and staurosporin, indicating that cyclophilin/calcineurin and protein kinase C may be involved in the R24 signaling pathway.
Additionally, herbimycin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked the R24-stimulated increase in proliferation but not cytotoxicity at concentrations consistent with specificity for tyrosine kinases.
These results suggest that multiple biochemical pathways are involved in the activation of human T cells by R24.
