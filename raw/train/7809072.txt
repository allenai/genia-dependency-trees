Identification of the TCL1 gene involved in T-cell malignancies.
The TCL1 locus on chromosome 14q32.1 is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations and inversions with one of the T-cell receptor loci in human T-cell leukemias and lymphomas.
The chromosome 14 region translocated or rearranged involves approximately 350 kb of DNA at chromosome band 14q32.1.
Within this region we have identified a gene coding for a 1.3-kb transcript, expressed only in restricted subsets of cells within the lymphoid lineage and expressed at high levels in leukemic cells carrying a t(14;14)(q11;q32) chromosome translocation or a inv(14)(q11;q32) chromosome inversion.
The cognate cDNA sequence reveals an open reading frame of 342 nt encoding a protein of 14 kDa.
The TCL1 gene sequence, which, to our knowledge, shows no sequence homology with other human genes, is preferentially expressed early in T- and B-lymphocyte differentiation.
