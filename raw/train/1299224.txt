Ablation of transplanted HTLV-I Tax-transformed tumors in mice by antisense inhibition of NF-kappa B [published erratum appears in Science 1993 Mar 12;259(5101):1523]
Mice transgenic for the human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) Tax gene develop fibroblastic tumors that express NF-kappa B-inducible early genes.
In vitro inhibition of NF-kappa B expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) inhibited growth of these culture-adapted Tax-transformed fibroblasts as well as an HTLV-I-transformed human lymphocyte line.
In contrast, antisense inhibition of Tax itself had no apparent effect on cell growth.
Mice treated with antisense to NF-kappa B ODNs showed rapid regression of transplanted fibrosarcomas.
This suggests that NF-kappa B expression may be necessary for the maintenance of the malignant phenotype and provides a therapeutic approach for HTLV-I-associated disease.
