Cortivazol mediated induction of glucocorticoid receptor messenger ribonucleic acid in wild-type and dexamethasone-resistant human leukemic (CEM) cells.
Cortivazol is a phenylpyrazolo glucocorticoid of high potency and unusual structure.
In both wild-type and highly dexamethasone(dex)-resistant clones of the human leukemic cell line CEM, exposure to cortivazol leads to cell death.
It has been shown recently that in wild-type CEM cells but not in a dex-resistant, glucocorticoid receptor(GR)-defective clone ICR-27 TK-3, dex induces GR mRNA.
To test the hypothesis that cortivazol acts in dex-resistant cells by making use of the residual GR found there, wild-type and dex-resistant clones were treated with various concentrations of cortivazol and induction of GR mRNA was studied.
Cortivazol significantly induced GR mRNA in the normal CEM-C7 as well as in two classes of dex-resistant clones, although the dex-resistant clones needed at least 10 times more cortivazol than the normal cells for significant GR mRNA induction.
Increased levels of GR mRNA were noticed as early as 3 h after treatment.
A general correlation between induction of GR mRNA and lysis of the normal and dex-resistant cells was found.
Positive induction of GR mRNA might be one of the earliest crucial steps in the lysis of normal and dex-resistant CEM cells, or might serve as a marker for the process.
However, the lysis pathway in the dex-resistant cells is defective in that dex-resistant clones needed significantly more cortivazol than the normal cells for lysis of the cells.
