Lack of IL-12 signaling in human allergen-specific Th2 cells.
IL-12 is a powerful skewer of CD4+ T cell responses toward the Th1 phenotype by inducing IFN-gamma production in naive Th cells.
In the present study we addressed the question of whether IL-12 can reverse established Th2 responses into Th1/Th0 responses by inducing IFN-gamma production in memory Th2 cells.
To this aim, allergen-specific CD4+ T cell clones (TCC) were generated from the peripheral blood of three atopic patients, and their cytokine profiles were analyzed.
The majority of these TCC exhibited a strongly polarized Th2 cytokine profile, and the production of IFN-gamma could not be induced by exogenous IL-12.
Only those TCC with low IFN-gamma levels in the absence of IL-12 responded to IL-12 by additional enhancement of IFN-gamma production.
The IL-12 nonresponsiveness of the Th2 clones was further evident by the total lack of IL-12-induced phosphorylation of STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-4), a transcription factor that is typically involved in IL-12 signaling.
Consequently, IL-12 also failed to induce the DNA-binding activity of STAT4-containing complexes in the nuclei of these Th2 clones.
All TCC expressed equal levels of the low-affinity IL-12R beta1 subunit.
Our results indicate that human allergen-specific Th cells with strongly polarized Th2 cytokine profiles do not respond to IL-12 and, therefore, cannot be induced to produce IFN-gamma.
The apparent high frequency of IL-12-nonresponsive Th cells within the allergen-specific populations in atopic patients predicts a limited skewing potential of IL-12 in the case of established Th2 responses, but only affecting newly recruited naive Th cells.
