Identification of transcriptional suppressor proteins that bind to the negative regulatory element of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
Two different proteins which independently bound to neighboring sequences within the negative regulatory element (NRE) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were detected in the nuclear extract of a virus-infected human T cell line.
One of the factors bound to a novel dyad symmetrical sequence.
This sequence is well conserved in various HIV-1 isolates and partial homology was found with the promoter region of the human retinoblastoma gene.
Similar DNA binding activity was detected in a variety of virus-uninfected human T cell lines and HeLa cells by means of a gel mobility shift assay.
The other factor bound to a putative AP-1 recognition sequence predicted for the HIV-1 NRE.
However, this factor did not bind to a typical AP-1 site.
The insertion of multiple copies of the binding site for the former or latter factor into a heterologous promoter reduced the promoter activity to one-tenth or one-third, respectively.
Thus, each factor may function as a novel negative regulator of transcription.
