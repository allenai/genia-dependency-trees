Minimal residual disease in acute myelogenous leukemia with PML/RAR alpha or AML1/ETO mRNA and phenotypic analysis of possible T and natural killer cells in bone marrow.
Here we studied minimal residual disease (MRD) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have PML/RAR alpha or AML1/ETO as well as the phenotypic analysis of lymphocyte subsets involved in antitumor immunity.
Eight patients in long-term (LT; 3 to 15 years) and 15 patients in short-term (ST; up to 3 years) remission were studied.
Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT) assay, the limit of detection was 10(-5) to 10(-6) for PML/RAR alpha transcript and 10(-4) to 10(-5) for the AML1/ETO transcript.
Simultaneously, T lymphocyte subsets and NK cells from the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) were investigated by flow cytometric analysis.
Four of the eight patients in LT and 7 of the 15 patients in ST remission were MRD-positive.
Although all MRD-positive patients in LT remission are still until now event-free, 3 of the 7 MRD-positive (MRD+) patients in ST remission soon relapsed.
The total populations of CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ [possible T-cell and natural killer (T/NK) populations] in the BM of ST patients and MRD+/LT patients were significantly (p < .01) low.
The CD8+ CD28+ population showed the same tendency (p < .01-.02).
The T/NK subsets in the BM of MRD-negative (MRD-) LT (MRD-/LT) patients showed similar numbers of cells as normal volunteers.
Basically, the total percentage of the CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ cell populations in the BM was increased and in the following order: MRD-/LT patients, normal volunteers, MRD+/LT patients and MRD+ or -/ST patients.
The percentages of the T/NK-cell subsets in the PB were not significantly different among these groups.
Thus, the difference of the possible T/NK-cell phenotype in the BM may strongly influence clinical and molecular remission.
These results still remain to be confirmed by further studies of the functional anti-tumor immunity of T/NK cells of AML in remission.
