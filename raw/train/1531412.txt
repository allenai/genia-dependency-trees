Transcriptional regulation during T-cell development: the alpha TCR gene as a molecular model.
The regulation of gene expression during lymphocyte differentiation is a complex process involving interactions between multiple positive and negative transcriptional regulatory elements.
In this article, transcriptional regulation of the archetypal T-cell-specific gene, alpha TCR, is discussed.
Major recent developments, including the identification of novel families of transcription factors that regulate multiple T-cell genes during thymocyte ontogeny and T-cell activation, are described.
