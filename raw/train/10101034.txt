Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 expression by 4-trifluoromethyl derivatives of salicylate, triflusal, and its deacetylated metabolite, 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid.
The therapeutic potential of drugs that block the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 has been emphasized.
When two 4-trifluoromethyl salicylate derivatives [2-acetoxy-4-trifluoromethyl-benzoic acid (triflusal) and its deacetylated metabolite 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid (HTB)] were compared with aspirin and sodium salicylate as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, we observed that in bacterial lipopolysaccharide-activated human blood, triflusal, aspirin, and HTB, but not sodium salicylate, inhibited COX-2-mediated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production (IC50 = 0.16, 0.18, 0.39, and >10 mM, respectively).
However, only triflusal and aspirin inhibited purified COX-2 enzyme.
To test this apparent discrepancy, we realized that HTB and triflusal (but neither aspirin nor salicylate) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of COX-2 protein expression in peripheral human mononuclear cells.
This observation was further confirmed in a rat air pouch model in vivo, in which both aspirin and triflusal inhibited PGE2 production (ID50 = 18.9 and 11.4 mg/kg p.o., respectively) but only triflusal-treated animals showed a decrease in COX-2 expression.
This different behavior may be, at least in part, due to the ability of HTB and triflusal to block the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB to a higher extent than aspirin and sodium salicylate.
Thus, in addition to inhibiting the COX-2 activity at therapeutic concentrations, triflusal is able to block through its metabolite HTB the expression of new enzyme, and hence the resumption of PGE2 synthesis.
Triflusal and HTB may exert beneficial effects in processes in which de novo COX-2 expression is involved and, in a broader sense, in pathological situations in which genes under nuclear factor-kappaB control are up-regulated.
