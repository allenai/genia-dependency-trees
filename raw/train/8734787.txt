Stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex signaling pathway by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate is mediated by inhibition of CD45: evidence for two interconnected Lck/Fyn- or zap-70-dependent signaling pathways.
The tyrosine phosphatase specific inhibitor pervanadate is a potent activator of T lymphocytes through induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream events of the activation cascade.
Using CD45- or CD3-negative variants of the Jurkat leukemic T-cell line we show that the different biochemical events induced by pervanadate appeared to be dependent on the presence at the cell surface of either CD45 or CD3.
CD45-dependent events such as tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), activator protein-1 (AP-1), transcription factors, and stimulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter and of CD69 and CD25 surface expression paralleled activation of the tyrosine kinases lck and fyn.
By contrast, stimulation of calcium influx, a CD3-dependent event, paralleled zap-70 activation.
The data demonstrate that the T-cell antigen receptor-CD3 (TcR-CD3) complex is functionally linked to two different protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) modules with separate specific functions and that CD45 may be an important regulator of this coupling.
