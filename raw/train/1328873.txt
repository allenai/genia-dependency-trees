Characterization of a new tissue-specific transcription factor binding to the simian virus 40 enhancer TC-II (NF-kappa B) element.
We have biochemically and functionally characterized a new transcription factor, NP-TCII, which is present in nuclei from unstimulated T and B lymphocytes but is not found in nonhematopoietic cells.
This factor has a DNA-binding specificity similar to that of NF-kappa B but is unrelated to this or other Rel proteins by functional and biochemical criteria.
It can also be distinguished from other previously described lymphocyte-specific DNA-binding proteins.
