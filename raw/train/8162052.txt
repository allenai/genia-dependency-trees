Genes encoding general initiation factors for RNA polymerase II transcription are dispersed in the human genome.
General transcription factors are required for accurate initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II.
Human cDNAs encoding subunits of these factors have been cloned and sequenced.
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we show here that the genes encoding the TATA-box binding protein (TBP), TFIIB, TFIIE alpha, TFIIE beta, RAP30, RAP74 and the 62 kDa subunit, of TFIIH are located at the human chromosomal bands 6q26-27, 1p21-22, 3q21-24, 8p12, 13q14, 19p13.3 and 11p14-15.1, respectively.
This dispersed localization of a group of functionally related gene provides insights into the molecular mechanism of human genome evolution and their possible involvement in human diseases.
