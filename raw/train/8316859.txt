Regulation of lymphoid-specific immunoglobulin mu heavy chain gene enhancer by ETS-domain proteins.
The enhancer for the immunoglobulin mu heavy chain gene (IgH) activates a heterologous gene at the pre-B cell stage of B lymphocyte differentiation.
A lymphoid-specific element, microB, is necessary for enhancer function in pre-B cells.
A microB binding protein is encoded by the PU.1/Spi-1 proto-oncogene.
Another sequence element, microA, was identified in the mu enhancer that binds the product of the ets-1 proto-oncogene.
The microA motif was required for microB-dependent enhancer activity, which suggests that a minimal B cell-specific enhancer is composed of both the PU.1 and Ets-1 binding sites.
Co-expression of both PU.1 and Ets-1 in nonlymphoid cells trans-activated reporter plasmids that contained the minimal mu enhancer.
These results implicate two members of the Ets family in the activation of IgH gene expression.
