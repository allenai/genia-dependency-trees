Activation of early growth response 1 gene transcription and pp90rsk during induction of monocytic differentiation.
The present work has studied mechanisms responsible for induction of early growth response 1 (EGR-1) gene expression during monocytic differentiation of U-937 myeloid leukemia cells.
Differentiation of U-937 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an activator of the serine/threonine protein kinase C, was associated with transcriptional activation of EGR-1 promoter-reporter constructs.
The EGR-1 promoter contains six CC(A/T)6GG (CArG) motifs.
The two 5'-most distal CArG sequences conferred TPA inducibility.
In contrast, there was little effect of TPA on EGR-1 transcription in a TPA-resistant U-937 cell variant, designated TUR.
Treatment of both U-937 and TUR cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, was associated with induction of monocytic differentiation and EGR-1 transcription through the 5'-most CArG element.
Since these findings supported the involvement of serine/threonine protein phosphorylation in the regulation of EGR-1 expression, we studied activation of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 serine/threonine kinases, pp70S6K and pp90rsk.
Although both kinases participate in regulating cell growth, there was no detectable activation of pp70S6K during TPA- or okadaic acid-induced monocytic differentiation.
Moreover, rapamycin, an inhibitor of pp70S6K activation, had no effect on induction of EGR-1 expression.
In contrast, analysis of pp90rsk activity by phosphorylation of a peptide derived from S6 protein demonstrated stimulation of this kinase in TPA-treated U-937, and not TUR, cells.
Okadaic acid treatment of both cell types was associated with activation of pp90rsk.
