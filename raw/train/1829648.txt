Characterization of an immediate-early gene induced in adherent monocytes that encodes I kappa B-like activity.
We have cloned a group of cDNAs representing mRNAs that are rapidly induced following adherence of human monocytes.
One of the induced transcripts (MAD-3) encodes a protein of 317 amino acids with one domain containing five tandem repeats of the cdc10/ankyrin motif, which is 60% similar (46% identical) to the ankyrin repeat region of the precursor of NF-kappa B/KBF1 p50.
The C-terminus has a putative protein kinase C phosphorylation site.
In vitro translated MAD-3 protein was found to specifically inhibit the DNA-binding activity of the p50/p65 NF-kappa B complex but not that of the p50/p50 KBF1 factor or of other DNA-binding proteins.
The MAD-3 cDNA encodes an I kappa B-like protein that is likely to be involved in regulation of transcriptional responses to NF-kappa B, including adhesion-dependent pathways of monocyte activation.
