Activation of Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by terminal complement complexes is G protein dependent.
Assembly of terminal complement complexes (TCC) C5b-7, C5b-8, and C5b-9 on target cells during acute and chronic inflammation induces hydrolysis of plasma membrane phospholipids and heterotrimeric G protein activation.
TCC also stimulate a variety of cellular activities, which include cytokine synthesis, proto-oncogene activation, and mitotic signaling.
Now we report that sublytic TCC induced Ras, Raf-1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 activation in JY25 B cell line.
When cells were exposed to C5b-9, GTP-bound Ras in anti-C5b-9 immunoprecipitates was increased 3.2-fold at 2 min, while GTP-bound Ras in anti-Ras immunoprecipitates was increased 2-fold at 10 min.
Both C5b-9 and C5b-7, but not C5b6, increased Raf-1 kinase activity maximum 3.3-fold at 2 min and 2.8-fold at 5 min, respectively.
ERK1 activity was 2-fold increased by C5b-9 at 2 min and by C5b-7 at 10 min, over the C5b6 level.
The role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway on TCC-inducible mitotic signaling was evaluated by assessing DNA synthesis and activator protein 1 (AP-1) DNA-binding activity.
The MAPK/ERK-specific inhibitor PD 098,059 abolished the C5b-9-induced DNA synthesis.
Involvement of G protein in the activation of MAPK pathway by TCC was indicated by inhibition of Raf-1 and ERK1 kinase activity, as well as the DNA synthesis by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin.
Overexpression of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 carboxyl-terminal peptide in JY25 cells also inhibited Raf-1 and ERK1 activity, indicating a direct involvement of G betagamma subunits in the signal transduction generated through activation of MAPK pathway by TCC assembly in the plasma membrane.
