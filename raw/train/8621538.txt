Interactions of a transcriptional activator in the env gene of the mouse mammary tumor virus with activation-dependent, T cell-specific transacting factors.
The mouse mammary tumor virus env gene contains a transcriptional activator (META) that can control transcription of the adjacent long terminal repeat region.
Transcriptional control by META parallels that of several lymphokine genes, being specific to T cells, dependent on their activation, and inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine (CsA).
DNase I footprinting indicated that nuclear factors from activated T lymphocytes bound a promoter-proximal site, META(P), and a promoter-distal site, META(D+), within the 400-base pair META region.
Nuclear factors from unstimulated, but not from activated cells, bound a site, META(D-), adjacent to META(D+).
META(D+) directed transcription of a linked luciferase gene, and gel shift analysis revealed binding of inducible, CsA-sensitive T cell factors, in parallel with transfection results.
Authentic NFAT and NF-kappaB targets did not compete for the META(D+) binding factor(s).
The SV40 core sequence competed for META(D+) binding factors, but META(D+) failed to compete for the complexes obtained with the SV40 probe.
Our results, taken together, indicate that META(D+) is a novel transcriptional enhancer element that is similar in its cell-type specificity, activation dependence, and CsA sensitivity to the NFAT element.
It may be relevant to the role of MMTV in expression of Mls antigens or the induction of T cell lymphomas.
