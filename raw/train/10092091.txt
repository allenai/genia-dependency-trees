NF-kappaB regulates Fas/APO-1/CD95- and TCR- mediated apoptosis of T lymphocytes.
The maintenance of lymphocyte homeostasis by apoptosis is a critical regulatory mechanism in the normal immune system.
The transcription factor NF-kappaB has been shown to play a role in protecting cells against death mediated by TNF
We show here that NF-kappaB also has a role in regulating Fas/APO-1/CD95-mediated death, a major pathway of peripheral T cell death.
Transfection of Jurkat cells with the NF-kappaB subunits p50 and p65 confers resistance against Fas-mediated apoptosis.
Reciprocally, inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by a soluble peptide inhibitor or a dominant form of the NF-kappaB inhibitor, IkappaB, makes the cells more susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis.
Furthermore, inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by a soluble peptide inhibitor rendered a T cell hybridoma more susceptible to TCR-mediated apoptosis.
Correspondingly, transfection of p50 and p65 provided considerable protection from TCR-mediated apoptosis.
These observations were corroborated by studies on Fas-mediated death in primary T cells.
Concanavalin A-activated cycling T cell blasts from mice that are transgenic for the dominant IkappaB molecule have increased sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis, associated with a down-regulation of NF-kappaB complexes in the nucleus.
In addition, blocking TNF, itself a positive regulator of NF-kappaB, with neutralizing antibodies renders the cells more susceptible to anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis.
In summary, our results provide compelling evidence that NF-kappaB protects against Fas-mediated death and is likely to be an important regulator of T cell homeostasis and tolerance.
