The transcription factor, Nm23H2, binds to and activates the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt's lymphoma.
We have identified an in vivo footprint over the PuF site on the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt's lymphoma cells.
The PuF site on the silent normal c-myc allele was unoccupied.
We demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay with antibody, UV cross-linking followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and Western analysis that Nm23H2 in B cell nuclear extracts bound to the c-myc PuF site.
Transfection experiments with c-myc promoter constructs in both DHL-9 and Raji cells revealed that the PuF site functioned as a positive regulatory element in B cells with a drop in activity with mutation of this site.
Access to this site is blocked in the normal silent c-myc allele; these data suggest that the Nm23H2 protein is involved in deregulation of the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt's lymphoma cells.
