Hematopoietic lineage commitment: role of transcription factors.
This review focuses on the roles of transcription factors in hematopoietic lineage commitment.
A brief introduction to lineage commitment and asymmetric cell division is followed by a discussion of several methods used to identify transcription factors important in specifying hematopoietic cell types.
Next is presented a discussion of the use of embryonic stem cells in the analysis of hematopoietic gene expression and the use of targeted gene disruption to analyze the role of transcription factors in hematopoiesis.
Finally, the status of our current knowledge concerning the roles of transcription factors in the commitment to erythroid, myeloid and lymphoid cell types is summarized.
