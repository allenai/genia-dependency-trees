Identification of target genes of the lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct2.
The Oct2 transcription factor is expressed predominantly in B lymphocytes and plays an essential role during the terminal phase of B cell differentiation.
The regulatory regions of several genes specifically expressed in B cells contain functional binding sites for Oct2.
Nevertheless, none of the genes originally thought to be regulated by Oct2 were affected in their expression in Oct2-deficient B cells.
In an attempt to find such elusive Oct2 target genes and to understand the molecular function of Oct2 in B cell development, we isolated cDNAs for Oct2 target genes.
So far, we have identified five potential targets for Oct2: the membrane glycoprotein CD36, the cysteine-rich secreted protein 3 (CRISP-3), a mouse homolog of the human monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor (mEI) and two unknown cDNA sequences Nov1 and Nov2.
These target genes show quite distinct expression patterns demonstrating that transcription factors in addition to Oct2 are involved in their regulation.
Whereas CD36 and mEI were expressed in all hematopoetic cell lines containing Oct2,. CRISP-3 is pre-B cell-specific, Nov1 is plasma B cell-specific and Nov2 is B cell-specifically expressed.
