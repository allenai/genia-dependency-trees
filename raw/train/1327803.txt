Leukotriene B4 transcriptionally activates interleukin-6 expression involving NK-chi B and NF-IL6.
Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a notable participant in inflammation and chemotaxis.
It is, however, still unclear whether LTB4 acts in this regard directly or indirectly by stimulating the release of chemotactic and inflammatory cytokines.
Here we report that LTB4 induces synthesis of interleukin (IL)-6 by human blood monocytes through transcriptional activation of the IL-6 gene.
We furthermore demonstrate that this process involves activation of the transcription factor NF-chi B and, to a lesser extent, of NF-IL6, while the activity of the transcription factor AP-1, shown to otherwise confer IL-6 inducibility, appeared to be unaffected by LTB4.
Involvement of NF-chi B and NF-IL6 in induction of IL-6 transcription by monocytes was demonstrated using deleted forms of the IL-6 promoter.
Activation of the IL-6 promoter by LTB4 was not only associated with accumulation of the respective transcripts but resulted in synthesis of functional IL-6 protein as well.
In addition, LTB4 mediated transactivation of a heterologous promoter construct containing the NF-chi B or the NF-IL6 enhancer, but not the AP-1 enhancer.
The signaling events mediating this effect appeared to involve the release of H2O2, since LTB4 failed to induce NF-chi B or NF-IL6 in the presence of the scavenger of H2O2, N-acetyl-L-cysteine.
