Targeted remodeling of human beta-globin promoter chromatin structure produces increased expression and decreased silencing.
The chromatin structure of the human beta-globin gene locus assumes a transcriptionally-active conformation in erythroid cells.
One feature of this chromatin reorganization is the formation of DNase 1 hypersensitive sites in the regions of active globin gene promoters.
This reorganization requires the globin locus control region and is associated with normal expression of the beta-like globin genes.
To determine whether it is possible to artificially enhance the opening of the chromatin structure of a minimal beta-globin promoter, we placed a 101bp, erythroid-specific DNase 1 hypersensitive site-forming element (HSFE) immediately upstream of the beta-globin promoter and gene.
This element includes binding sites for NF-E2, AP-1, GATA-1 and Sp-1.
Constructs were stably transfected into murine erythroleukemia cells and promoter chromatin structure and gene expression were analyzed.
The HSFE induced an area of enhanced DNase 1 hypersensitivity extending from the transcriptional start site to -300bp of the artificial promoter and significantly increased the proportion of beta-globin promoters in an open chromatin configuration.
This remodeling of promoter chromatin structure resulted in 3-fold increases in beta-globin gene transcription and induction, and inhibited long-term beta-globin gene silencing.
These results indicate that a relatively small cis-acting element is able to enhance remodeling of promoter chromatin structure resulting in increased beta-globin gene expression.
