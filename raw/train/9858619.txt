Interdomain B in ZAP-70 regulates but is not required for ZAP-70 signaling function in lymphocytes.
The protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 plays an important role in T-cell activation and development.
After T-cell receptor stimulation, ZAP-70 associates with the receptor and is phosphorylated on many tyrosines, including Y292, Y315, and Y319 within interdomain B.
Previously, we demonstrated that Y292 negatively regulates ZAP-70 function and that Y315 positively regulates ZAP-70 function by interacting with Vav.
Recent studies have suggested that Y319 also positively regulate ZAP-70 function.
Paradoxically, removal of interdomain B (to create the construct designated Delta), containing the Y292, Y315, and Y319 sites, did not eliminate the ability of ZAP-70 to induce multiple gene reporters in Syk-deficient DT-40 B cells and ZAP-70/Syk-deficient Jurkat cells.
Here we show that Delta still utilizes the same pathways as wild-type ZAP-70 to mediate NF-AT induction.
This is manifested by the ability of Delta to restore induction of calcium fluxes and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and by the ability of dominant negative Ras and FK506 to block the induction of NF-AT activity mediated by Delta.
Biochemically we show that the stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav, Shc, and ZAP-70 itself is diminished, whereas that of Slp-76 is increased in cells reconstituted with Delta.
Deletion of interdomain B did not affect the ability of ZAP-70 to bind to the receptor.
The in vitro kinase activity of ZAP-70 lacking interdomain B was markedly reduced, but the kinase activity was still required for the protein's in vivo activity.
Based on these data, we concluded that interdomain B regulates but is not required for ZAP-70 signaling function leading to cellular responses.
