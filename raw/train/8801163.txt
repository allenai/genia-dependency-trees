Retinoid differentiation therapy in promyelocytic leukemia.
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a specific type of acute myeloid leukemia characterized by the morphology of the blast cells, a specific t(15;17) translocation, and risks of definite coagulopathy.
Recently this leukemia was further characterized by an exquisite sensitivity to all-trans retinoic acid's differentiation effect and the production of a fusion gene altering the gene of RARalpha and a novel gene PML.
In vivo differentiation therapy with retinoids in APL patients follows strict guidelines related both to the APL cell and the biodisposal of all-trans retinoic acid.
