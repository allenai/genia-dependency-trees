Up-regulation of high-affinity dehydroepiandrosterone binding activity by dehydroepiandrosterone in activated human T lymphocytes.
Although evidence indicates that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) exerts direct physiological effects, its mechanism of action remains unknown.
DHEA binding sites were examined using a whole-cell binding assay in a human T lymphoid cell line, PEER, revealing that a single class of high-affinity binding sites for DHEA (dissociation constant = 7.4 +/- 0.53 nmol/L, mean +/- SE, n = 4) was greatly increased when treated with DHEA, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187.
Bound [3H]DHEA was displaced sensitively by DHEA and secondarily by dihydrotestosterone, but not effectively by other steroids, including DHEA sulfate.
These results not only indicate the existence of a DHEA receptor, but also suggest that T cells become susceptible to regulation by DHEA during the process of signal-induced activation.
