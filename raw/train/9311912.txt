Negative regulation by HLA-DO of MHC class II-restricted antigen processing.
HLA-DM is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-like molecule that facilitates antigen processing by catalyzing the exchange of invariant chain-derived peptides (CLIP) from class II molecules for antigenic peptides.
HLA-DO is a second class II-like molecule that physically associates with HLA-DM in B cells.
HLA-DO was shown to block HLA-DM function.
Purified HLA-DM-DO complexes could not promote peptide exchange in vitro.
Expression of HLA-DO in a class II+ and DM+, DO- human T cell line caused the accumulation of class II-CLIP complexes, indicating that HLA-DO blocked DM function in vivo and suggesting that HLA-DO is an important modulator of class II-restricted antigen processing.
