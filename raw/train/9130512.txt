Retinoic acid-induced modulation of IL-2 mRNA production and IL-2 receptor expression on T cells.
BACKGROUND: Retinoic acid (RA) has important immune-modulating effects on both T and B cell function.
Our laboratory has shown that RA can enhance in vitro polyclonal B cell immunoglobulin (Ig) response.
Investigating cytokines known to affect B cell differentiation, we have recently shown that IL-6 production is augmented by RA.
In the present study we have examined the immune modulating effects of RA on IL-2 mRNA, another important cytokine for B cell immunoglobulin production, the expression of IL-2 receptors on T cells, and the RA nuclear receptors.
METHODS: Purified T cells were obtained from adenoidal tissues, and incubated with RA (10(-7) M) or DMSO solvent/media control for 0, 6-8, and 24 h.
Total mRNA was extracted from T cells, and using RT-PCR, changes in the production of IL-2 and RA receptors (RAR)-alpha,beta,gamma mRNA were determined.
The effects of RA on IL-2-alpha receptor expression was determined by flow cytometry on T cells.
CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that RA can augment IL-2 mRNA production by T cells with a possible paracrine effect on IL-2R-alpha expression.
These changes appear to be mediated by RAR-alpha.
Thus, IL-2 may be another important cytokine modulated by RA in the immune response.
