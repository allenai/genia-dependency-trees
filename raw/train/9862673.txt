CD27/CD70 interaction augments IgE secretion by promoting the differentiation of memory B cells into plasma cells.
The induction of IgE switching in B cells requires several signals given by cytokines and cell contact-delivered signals.
Here, we investigated the role of CD27/CD70 interaction in B cell IgE synthesis.
The addition of CD27 ligand (CD70) transfectants to B cell cultures increased the IgE synthesis synergistically in the presence of IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb (anti-CD40).
The effect of CD70 transfectants was dose dependent and was completely blocked by anti-CD70 mAb.
CD27+ B cells had the ability to produce IgE, which was increased by contact with CD70 transfectants, whereas CD27- B cells did not produce IgE.
CD27/CD70 interaction enhanced B cell proliferation in the presence of IL-4 or IL-4 plus anti-CD40.
The augmentation of B cell proliferation by CD70 transfectants was apparent in CD27+ B cells, but was mild in CD27- B cells.
The helper activity for IgE synthesis by the CD27/CD70 interaction did not contribute to the enhancement of germline epsilon transcripts.
Flow cytometric and morphological analyses demonstrated that the addition of CD70 transfectants to B cell cultures remarkably promoted differentiation into plasma cells in the presence of IL-4 and CD40 signaling.
Finally, CD27 cross-linking resulted in the up-regulation of positive regulatory domain I-binding factor-1.
Taken together, our findings indicate that signaling via CD27 on B cells induces IgE synthesis, in cooperation with IL-4 and CD40 signaling, by promoting the generation of plasma cells through up-regulation of positive regulatory domain I-binding factor-1.
