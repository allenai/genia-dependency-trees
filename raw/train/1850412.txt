Vitamin D receptor expression in human lymphocytes.
Signal requirements and characterization by western blots and DNA sequencing.
The signals controlling the expression of the receptor protein for 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in normal human lymphocytes and the relationship of this protein to the classical vitamin D receptor were examined.
Lymphocytes activated with the OKT3 antibody to the T-cell antigen receptor expressed fewer binding sites as compared to lymphocytes that were activated by the polyclonal activator phytohemagglutinin (PHA).
However, combination of OKT3 and phorbol myristate acetate produced a concentration of binding sites similar to the PHA-activated cells.
The receptor from OKT3 and OKT3 + phorbol myristate acetate-activated lymphocytes exhibited decreased binding to DNA-cellulose compared to PHA-activated lymphocytes.
In lymphocytes activated either by PHA or OKT3 (but not in resting cells), a 50-kDa species cross-reacting with a monoclonal antibody against the intestinal vitamin D receptor was detected.
Finally, RNA from activated lymphocytes was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers flanking the 196 base pair long region encoding the DNA-binding domain of the human intestinal receptor.
The amplified product showed an identical nucleotide sequence to the DNA-binding domain of the human intestinal receptor.
These findings suggest that expression of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor in lymphocytes is triggered by distinct and contingent signals, and that the protein and the mRNA encoding it are identical to the classical vitamin D receptor.
