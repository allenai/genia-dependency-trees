Activation of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor promoter in T cells requires cooperative binding of Elf-1 and AP-1 transcription factors.
The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene has been studied extensively as a model system of transcriptional induction during T-lymphocyte activation.
The GM-CSF gene is not expressed in resting peripheral blood T cells but is rapidly induced at the transcriptional level following activation through the cell surface T-cell receptor.
A highly conserved 19-bp element located immediately 5' of the human GM-CSF TATA box (bp -34 to -52), herein called purine box 1 (PB1), has been shown to bind a T-cell nuclear protein complex and to be required for transcriptional induction of the GM-CSF gene following T-cell activation.
The PB1 sequence motif is highly conserved in both human and murine GM-CSF genes.
In this report, we demonstrate that the PB1 element alone confers inducibility on a heterologous promoter following transfection into human Jurkat T cells.
In addition, we identify a major PB1 nuclear protein-binding complex that is not present in resting peripheral blood T cells but is rapidly induced following T-cell activation.
Sequence analysis revealed that PB1 is composed of adjacent binding sites for Ets and AP-1 transcription factors.
In vitro mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that both the Ets and AP-1 sites are required for binding of the inducible PB1 nuclear protein complex and for the transcriptional activity of this element and the GM-CSF promoter in activated T cells.
