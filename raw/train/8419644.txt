Human immunodeficiency viruses containing heterologous enhancer/promoters are replication competent and exhibit different lymphocyte tropisms.
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) contains binding sites for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and the constitutively expressed transcription factor Sp1, both of which are highly conserved in HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus isolates.
To delineate the effects of these motifs on the replicative capacity of HIV and to explore the possibility of extending the virus host range, known heterologous enhancer/promoters were inserted into the HIV-1 LTR in place of the NF-kappa B and Sp1 binding sites.
The effects of these substitutions on viral replication in transfected HeLa cells and on HIV infection of human peripheral blood lymphocytes or continuous T-leukemia cell lines were evaluated.
HIVs in which the NF-kappa B/Sp1 enhancer plus the downstream TATA element were replaced with heterologous enhancer/promoters were also constructed.
Viruses containing the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer exhibited infectious kinetics similar to that of wild-type HIV in activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes and AA2 cells but replicated less efficiently in H9 and CEM cells.
These studies indicate that heterologous enhancer elements are capable of restoring Tat responsiveness to the HIV LTR in the context of directing reporter gene expression as well as in the production of infectious progeny virions.
