Comparison of the transactivation domains of Stat5 and Stat6 in lymphoid cells and mammary epithelial cells.
Stat (signal transducers and activators of transcription) and Jak (Janus kinases) proteins are central components in the signal transduction events in hematopoietic and epithelial cells.
They are rapidly activated by various cytokines, hormones, and growth factors.
Upon ligand binding and cytokine receptor dimerization, Stat proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by Jak kinases.
Activated Stat proteins form homo- or heterodimers, translocate to the nucleus, and induce transcription from responsive genes.
Stat5 and Stat6 are transcription factors active in mammary epithelial cells and immune cells.
Prolactin activates Stat5, and interleukin-4 (IL-4) activates Stat6.
Both cytokines are able to stimulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.
We investigated the transactivation potential of Stat6 and found that it is not restricted to lymphocytes.
IL-4-dependent activation of Stat6 was also observed in HC11 mammary epithelial cells.
In these cells, Stat6 activation led to the induction of the beta-casein gene promoter.
The induction of this promoter was confirmed in COS7 cells.
The glucocorticoid receptor was able to further enhance IL-4-induced gene transcription through the action of Stat6.
Deletion analysis of the carboxyl-terminal region of Stat6 and recombination of this region with a heterologous DNA binding domain allowed the delimitation and characterization of the transactivation domain of Stat6.
The potencies of the transactivation domains of Stat5, Stat6, and viral protein VP16 were compared.
Stat6 had a transactivation domain which was about 10-fold stronger than that of Stat5.
In pre-B cells (Ba/F3), the transactivation domain of Stat6 was IL-4 regulated, independently from its DNA binding function.
