Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type-I tax gene induces secretion of human macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha.
Human T-cell lymphotropic virus I (HTLV-I) encodes for a 40-kDa protein, Tax, which is important for the immortalization of T cells.
Tax has been shown to transactivate several cellular genes.
In this study, we show that MIP-1alpha is selectively expressed and secreted in the tax transfected Jurkat cell line upon mitogen stimulation.
Expression of MIP-1alpha-R mRNA in these cells suggests an autocrine role for this chemokine in HTLV-I infected T-cells.
Induced MIP-1alpha expression and secretion in PMA/PHA stimulated tax transfected cells correlate with the noninduction of MNP-1 transcription factor, which is intimately involved in downmodulating the MIP-1alpha gene.
