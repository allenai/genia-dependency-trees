1,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3 and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate synergistically induce monocytic cell differentiation: FOS and RB expression.
1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) interact synergistically to induce monocytic differentiation of U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells.
Addition of TPA causes an otherwise ineffective dose of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 to induce differentiation.
The induced differentiation depends on the simultaneous (vs. sequential) presence of both agents.
The kinetics of induced differentiation are consistent with a G1 specific cellular response to initiate the metabolic cascade culminating in cell differentiation.
The induced differentiation occurs with down-regulation of c-fos protein and an accompanying up-regulation of RB protein expression, consistent with a possible need for up-regulated RB expression to maintain a given differentiated phenotype and suppress transcriptional activators that might typically be associated with proliferation.
