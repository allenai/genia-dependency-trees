Expression of mRNA for the GATA-binding proteins in human eosinophils and basophils: potential role in gene transcription.
The expression of the hematopoietic transcription factors GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3 was studied in eosinophils and basophils.
Eosinophils express mRNA for GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3.
Basophils express GATA-2 and GATA-3.
Treatment of HL-60 eosinophilic sublines with either interleukin-5 or butyric acid increased the expression of GATA-1 mRNA concomitant with the expression of eosinophil-specific genes, whereas levels of GATA-2 mRNA remained relatively constant.
The presence of mRNA for these proteins in eosinophils and basophils suggests that gene transcription in these lineages may be regulated by GATA-binding proteins.
