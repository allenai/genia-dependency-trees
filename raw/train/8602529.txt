A mammalian histone deacetylase related to the yeast transcriptional regulator Rpd3p [see comments]
Trapoxin is a microbially derived cyclotetrapeptide that inhibits histone deacetylation in vivo and causes mammalian cells to arrest in the cell cycle.
A trapoxin affinity matrix was used to isolate two nuclear proteins that copurified with histone deacetylase activity.
Both proteins were identified by peptide microsequencing, and a complementary DNA encoding the histone deacetylase catalytic subunit (HD1) was cloned from a human Jurkat T cell library.
As the predicted protein is very similar to the yeast transcriptional regulator Rpd3p, these results support a role for histone deacetylase as a key regulator of eukaryotic transcription.
