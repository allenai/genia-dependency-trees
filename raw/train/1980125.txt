Oncogene amplification correlates with dense lymphocyte infiltration in human breast cancers: a role for hematopoietic growth factor release by tumor cells?
One hundred six primary breast cancer samples were analysed for c-erbB2, int-2, and c-myc gene amplification.
Surgically confirmed nodal involvement was observed in 42%.
Level of gene amplification was studied by Southern and/or slot blot techniques.
Amplified c-erbB2 gene sequences were present in 21.5% of all samples.
Int-2 was amplified in 13.1% and c-myc was amplified in 10.3%.
In a non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis) a strong negative association was found between high levels of c-erbB2 amplification and absence of estrogen receptor (ER) (P = .0009) or progesterone receptor (PR) (P = .011) expression.
No correlations were found between all or high levels of amplification of each oncogene separately or combined with T, N, grade, multifocality of tumor, or associated carcinoma in situ.
There was a trend approaching statistical significance for patients with c-erbB2 amplifications to have positive lymph nodes at surgery (P = 0.09).
A somewhat surprising finding however was a very strong association between oncogene amplification and dense lymphocyte infiltration of the tumor (P = .05).
This correlation is even stronger when only high levels of amplification are considered, either for each oncogene separately (P = .0048) or in combination (P = .0007).
We propose that malignant cell cytokine production may help explain this observation.
