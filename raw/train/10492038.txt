Immunocytochemical analysis of MNDA in tissue sections and sorted normal bone marrow cells documents expression only in maturing normal and neoplastic myelomonocytic cells and a subset of normal and neoplastic B lymphocytes.
The human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) is a nuclear antigen known to be expressed in mature myelomonocytic cell lines.
An extensive immunocytochemical evaluation of fixed tissues confirmed MNDA expression in normal maturing granulocytes and monocytes and in acute nonlymphocytic leukemias and chronic myelogenous leukemia.
MNDA was not detected in normal tissue histiocytes but was found in activated macrophages and foreign body giant cells associated with inflammation.
Flow cytometric cell sorting of normal bone marrow established that MNDA is initially expressed in myeloid blast cells.
Examination of lymphoid tissues showed a low level of expression in a population of normal mande B lymphocytes but not in germinal center cells or plasma cells.
A subset of B cell neoplasms expressing MNDA included hairy cell leukemia, parafollicular (monocytoid) B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma.
Cell sorting of normal bone marrow showed MNDA expression in CD20+/CD10-/CD5- B cells.
MNDA was not detected in other normal bone marrow or all other nonhematopoietic cells.
The hematopoietic cell-specific pattern of MNDA expression was elucidated through a comprehensive analysis of normal and neoplastic tissues, and the results provide further evidence of the coexpression of B- and myeloid cell markers in neoplastic B cells and identify a normal B cell population that might be related to the cell of origin of a subset of B cell neoplasms.
