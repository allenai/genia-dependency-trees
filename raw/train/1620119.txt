Oct2 transactivation from a remote enhancer position requires a B-cell-restricted activity.
Previous cotransfection experiments had demonstrated that ectopic expression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor Oct2 could efficiently activate a promoter containing an octamer motif.
Oct2 expression was unable to stimulate a multimerized octamer enhancer element in HeLa cells, however.
We have tested a variety of Oct2 isoforms generated by alternative splicing for the capability to activate an octamer enhancer in nonlymphoid cells and a B-cell line.
Our analyses show that several Oct2 isoforms can stimulate from a remote position but that this stimulation is restricted to B cells.
This result indicates the involvement of either a B-cell-specific cofactor or a specific modification of a cofactor or the Oct2 protein in Oct2-mediated enhancer activation.
Mutational analyses indicate that the carboxy-terminal domain of Oct2 is critical for enhancer activation.
Moreover, this domain conferred enhancing activity when fused to the Oct1 protein, which by itself was unable to stimulate from a remote position.
The glutamine-rich activation domain present in the amino-terminal portion of Oct2 and the POU domain contribute only marginally to the transactivation function from a distal position.
