Nuclear factor of activated T cells contains Fos and Jun.
The nuclear factor NF-AT (ref. 1) is induced in T cells stimulated through the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex, and is required for interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene induction.
Although NF-AT has not been cloned or purified, there is evidence that it is a major target for immunosuppression by cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 (refs 2-7).
NF-AT induction may require two activation-dependent events: the CsA-sensitive translocation of a pre-existing component and the CsA-resistant synthesis of a nuclear component.
Here we report that the newly synthesized nuclear component of NF-AT is the transcription factor AP-1.
We show that the inducible nuclear form of NF-AT contains Fos and Jun proteins.
Furthermore, we identify a pre-existing NF-AT-binding factor that is present in hypotonic extracts of unstimulated T cells.
On the basis of binding, reconstitution and cotransfection experiments, we propose that activation of NF-AT occurs in at least two stages: a CsA-sensitive stage involving modification and/or translocation of the pre-existing NF-AT complex, and a CsA-insensitive stage involving the addition of newly synthesized Fos or Fos/Jun proteins to the pre-existing complex.
