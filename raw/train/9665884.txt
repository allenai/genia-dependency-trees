Uncoupling of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases from PLC-gamma1 in an SLP-76-deficient T cell.
Activation of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) is essential for T cell receptor (TCR) responsiveness; however, the function of individual PTK substrates is often uncertain.
A mutant T cell line was isolated that lacked expression of SLP-76 (SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kilodaltons), a hematopoietically expressed adaptor protein and PTK substrate.
SLP-76 was not required for TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of most proteins, but was required for optimal tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1), as well as Ras pathway activation.
TCR-inducible gene expression was dependent on SLP-76.
Thus, coupling of TCR-regulated PTKs to downstream signaling pathways requires SLP-76.
