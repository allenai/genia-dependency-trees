Dicarba-closo-dodecaboranes as a pharmacophore.
Retinoidal antagonists and potential agonists.
Synthesis and biological evaluation of the first dicarba-closo-dodecaborane (carborane) derivatives of retinoids are described.
Their retinoidal activity were examined in terms of the differentiation-inducing ability toward human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells.
High retinoidal activity (agonist or antagonist for retinoic acid receptor (RAR) requires a carboxylic acid moiety and an appropriate hydrophobic group located at a suitable position on the molecule.
The 4-carboranyl-substituted compounds (7, 11) showed antagonistic activity but no agonistic activity even in the presence of the potent synergist HX630.
On the other hand, the 3-carboranyl-substituted compounds (8, 12) showed potential agonistic activity, but no antagonistic activity.
The results indicates that carboranes are applicable as the hydrophobic moiety of biologically active molecules.
