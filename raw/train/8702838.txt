Elevated cyclic AMP inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated transcription in human monocytic cells and endothelial cells.
The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors regulates the inducible expression of many genes in activated human monocytes and endothelial cells.
In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism by which agents that elevate intracellular cAMP inhibit the expression of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), tissue factor, endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 genes.
Both forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP, which elevate intracellular cAMP by independent mechanisms, inhibited TNFalpha and tissue factor expression at the level of transcription.
Induction of NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression in transiently transfected human monocytic THP-1 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells was inhibited by elevated cAMP and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA).
Elevated cAMP did not prevent nuclear translocation of p50/p65 and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers, decrease nuclear translocation of p65, or significantly modify TNFalpha-induced phosphorylation of p65.
Functional studies demonstrated that transcriptional activation of a plasmid containing multimerized kappaB sites by p65 was inhibited by agents that elevate cAMP and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA.
This study indicates that activation of PKA reduces the induction of a distinct set of genes in monocytes and endothelial cells by inhibiting NF-kappaB-mediated transcription.
