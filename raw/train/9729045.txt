CD30 is a CD40-inducible molecule that negatively regulates CD40-mediated immunoglobulin class switching in non-antigen-selected human B cells.
We used our monoclonal model of germinal center maturation, CL-01 B cells, to investigate the role of CD30 in human B cell differentiation.
CL-01 cells are IgM+ IgD+ CD30+ and switch to IgG, IgA, and IgE when exposed to CD40L and IL-4.
Switching is hampered by CD30 coengagement, possibly through interference with the CD40-mediated NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activation of downstream C(H) genes.
The physiological relevance of this phenomenon is emphasized by similar CD30-mediated effects in naive B cells.
Expression of CD30 by these cells is induced by CD40L but is inhibited by B cell receptor coengagement and/or exposure to IL-6 and IL-12.
Our data suggest that CD30 critically regulates the CD40-mediated differentiation of non-antigen-selected human B cells.
