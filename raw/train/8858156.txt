Human TAFII 105 is a cell type-specific TFIID subunit related to hTAFII130.
We previously characterized Drosophila and human TAF subunits that make up the core TFIID complex found in all cells.
Here, we report that differentiated B cells contain a novel substoichiometric TAF of 105 kDa not found associated with TFIID isolated from other cell types.
The cDNA encoding hTAFII105 reveals a highly conserved C-terminal domain shared by hTAFII130 and oTAFII110, while the N-terminal coactivator domain has diverged significantly.
All cells tested express TAFII105 mRNA, but only B cells contain significant levels of protein associated with TFIID.
Transient overexpression of hTAFII105 selectively squelches the transcription of some genes in B cells.
These properties suggest that TAFII105 is a cell type-specific subunit of TFIID that may be responsible for mediating transcription by a subset of activators in B cells.
