A p56lck-independent pathway of CD2 signaling involves Jun kinase.
The p56 Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase has been shown to be critical for T lymphocyte differentiation and activation.
Hence in the absence of p56, T cell receptor triggered activation does not occur.
We now provide evidence for a CD2-based signaling pathway which, in contrast to that of the T cell receptor, is independent of p56.
CD2-mediated interleukin-2 production occurs via activation of Jun kinase in cell lines lacking p56.
Jun kinase then facilitates the binding of c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers to the AP-1 consensus site and the subsequent transcriptional activity of the interleukin-2 promoter.
These data elucidate differences between TCR and CD2 signaling pathways in the same T cells.
