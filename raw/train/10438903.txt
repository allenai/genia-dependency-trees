Cutting edge: TCR stimulation by antibody and bacterial superantigen induces Stat3 activation in human T cells.
Recent data show that TCR/CD3 stimulation induces activation of Stat5 in murine T cells.
Here, we show that CD3 ligation by mAb and Staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) induce a rapid, gradually accumulating, long-lasting tyrosine, and serine phosphorylation of Stat3 (but not Stat5) in allogen-specific human CD4+ T cell lines.
In contrast, IL-2 induces a rapid and transient tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat3.
Compared with IL-2, CD3 ligation induces a delayed Stat3 binding to oligonucleotide probes from the ICAM-1 and IL-2R alpha promoter.
CD3-mediated activation of Stat3 is almost completely inhibited by a Src kinase inhibitor (PP1), whereas IL-2-induced Stat3 activation is unaffected.
In conclusion, we show that CD3 ligation by mAb and SE triggers a rapid, PP1-sensitive tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat3 in human CD4+ T cells.
Moreover, we provide evidence that TCR/CD3 and IL-2 induce Stat3 activation via distinct signaling pathways.
