[Regulation of intracellular cholesterol synthesis in hypercholesterolemia by glucocorticoids]
The rate of endogenous cholesterol synthesis in blood lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts from patients with type IIa hyperlipidemia was found to be increased in comparison with healthy donors.
The cells of hyperlipidemic patients had lowered levels of glucocorticoid receptors concomitantly with a partial loss of their sensitivity to glucocorticoids.
In fibroblasts from patients with hereditary hypercholesteremia of homozygous type the number of glucocorticoid receptors did not exceed 10% of their content in normal cells.
The decrease of the number of glucocorticoid receptors in patients with type IIa hyperlipidemia seems to be a compensatory response of cells culminating in activation of endogenous cholesterol synthesis.
