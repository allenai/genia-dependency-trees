Alternate immune system targets for TCDD: lymphocyte stem cells and extrathymic T-cell development.
We here summarize evidence that thymic atrophy induced by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) can be mediated, at least in part, by damage to extrathymic T-cell precursors in bone marrow and fetal liver.
This atrophy induction does not involve apoptotic mechanisms in thymocytes affected by the bcl-2 proto-oncogene.
TCDD mediates atrophy induction through its specific receptor (the AhR) and not through effects on the estrogen receptor.
Both TCDD and estradiol induce extrathymic T-cell differentiation in the liver.
These extrathymic T-cell populations include cells expressing elevated levels of V beta T-cell receptors that are normally deleted in thymic development.
