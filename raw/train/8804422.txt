IL4 and IL13 receptors share the gamma c chain and activate STAT6, STAT3 and STAT5 proteins in normal human B cells.
IL13 induces the same biological effects as IL4 in normal human B cells.
We show that as in the IL4R complex, both IL4R alpha and IL2R gamma c are components of the IL13R and that both cytokines induced STAT6, STAT3 and STAT5 activation in B cells.
In spite of this similar downstream signalling, IL4 and IL13 used a different set of Janus kinases: IL13 is unable to activate JAK1 and JAK3.
