Description and functional implications of a novel mutation in the sex-determining gene SRY.
The sex-determining gene SRY was screened for molecular alteration in an XY sex-reversed female by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique.
An A-to-G transition was detected which leads to an exchange of a tyrosine by a cysteine in the SRY protein.
The affected tyrosine residue located at the C terminus of the DNA binding protein is evolutionarily strongly conserved among the members of the HMG box containing proteins.
Using gel shift assay and peptide synthesis such a mutation is shown to abolish the SRY protein DNA binding ability.
The involvement of this particular amino acid in the binding specificity is also discussed.
