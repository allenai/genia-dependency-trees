A human putative lymphocyte G0/G1 switch gene homologous to a rodent gene encoding a zinc-binding potential transcription factor.
G0S24 is a member of a set of genes (putative G0/G1 switch regulatory genes) that are expressed transiently within 1-2 hr of the addition of lectin or cycloheximide to human blood mononuclear cells.
Comparison of a full-length cDNA sequence with the corresponding genomic sequence reveals an open reading frame of 326 amino acids, distributed across two exons.
Potential phosphorylation sites include the sequence PSPTSPT, which resembles an RNA polymerase II repeat reported to be a target of the cell cycle control kinase cdc2.
Comparison of the derived protein sequence with those of rodent homologs allows classification into three groups.
Group 1 contains G0S24 and the rat and mouse TIS11 genes (also known as TTP, Nup475, and Zfp36).
Members of this group have three tetraproline repeats.
Groups 1 and 2 have a serine-rich region and an "arginine element" (RRLPIF) at the carboxyl terminus.
All groups contain cysteine- and histidine-rich putative zinc finger domains and a serine-phenylalanine "SFS" domain similar to part of the large subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II.
Comparison of group 1 human and mouse genomic sequences shows high conservation in the 5' flank and exons.
A CpG island suggests expression in the germ line.
G0S24 has potential sites for transcription factors in the 5' flank and intron; these include a serum response element.
Protein and genomic sequences show similarities with those of a variety of proteins involved in transcription, suggesting that the G0S24 product has a similar role.
