The Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 interacts with an EBNA2 responsive cis-element of the terminal protein 1 gene promoter.
The Epstein-Barr virus protein EBNA2 acts as a transcriptional activator of cellular and viral genes and plays a crucial role in the immortalization of human primary B-cells by EBV.
We have shown previously that EBNA2 transactivates the promoters of the latent membrane antigens LMP, TP1 and TP2.
The promoter of the TP1 gene was chosen as a model system to study the molecular mechanism of EBNA2 mediated transactivation.
To identify an EBNA2 dependent cis-acting element, various TP1 promoter-reporter gene constructs were transfected in the absence and presence of an EBNA2 expression vector into the established B-cell line BL41-P3HR1.
We were able to delineate an 81 bp EBNA2 responsive region between -258 and -177 relative to the TP1 RNA start site.
The element worked in either orientation and could mediate EBNA2 dependent transactivation on a heterologous promoter.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed three specific protein-DNA complexes formed with sequences of the EBNA2 responsive element.
Two of these were not cell type specific, but the third was detected only in EBNA2 positive cell extracts.
Gel-shift analysis in the presence of EBNA2 specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that EBNA2 is a component of the third complex.
Thus, these experiments demonstrate that EBNA2 interacts with an EBNA2 responsive cis-element of the TP1 promoter.
