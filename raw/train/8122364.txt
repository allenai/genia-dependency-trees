trans-activation of the HIV promoter by a cDNA and its genomic clones of human herpesvirus-6.
Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a lymphotropic herpesvirus, and in vitro, it can productively infect human CD4+ T cells as HIV-1.
Co-infection of T cells by HIV-1 and HHV-6 can lead to both activation of the HIV-1 promoter and acceleration of the cytopathic effects.
An HHV-6 (GS) cDNA clone, pCD41, encoding for a 41-kDa nuclear protein was identified and characterized previously (Chang and Balachandran, J. Virol. 65, 2884-2894 and 7085, 1991).
Sequence analyses show that this protein has significant homology with the human cytomegalovirus UL44 gene coding for the ICP36 family of early-late-class phosphoprotein.
Using this cDNA as the probe, a 3.8-kb EcoRI genomic fragment encoding the HHV-6(GS)P41 was cloned and designated as pGD41.
When cotransfected with the HIV LTR CAT into CV-1 cells, both the pCD41 and pGD41 clones trans-activated the HIV LTR.
Sequence analyses of pCD41 indicate that there are two potential open reading frames (ORFs), A and B, which are homologous to the ORFs found in the genomic clone pGD41.
Deletion constructs of the pCD41 clone demonstrated that ORF-A was critical for the HIV LTR activation.
Deletion analyses of the pCD41 ORF-A and the use of promoter constructs further mapped an internal functional promoter within the pCD41 sequence that can direct the synthesis of the trans-activating protein.
By using HIV LTR deletion mutants, the NF-kappa B binding sites were found to be critical for response to the pCD41 trans-activation.
