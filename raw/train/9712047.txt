Cyclosporin A-resistant transactivation of the IL-2 promoter requires activity of okadaic acid-sensitive serine/threonine phosphatases.
Expression of the IL-2 gene requires activation of T cells through stimulation of the TCR and costimulation through accessory receptors.
We have found recently that okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases are involved in a cyclosporin A-insensitive pathway that selectively transmits costimulatory signals.
In this study, we analyzed whether activities of these phosphatases are necessary for the expression of the IL-2 gene.
In both activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes and activated tumorigenic T cell lines, IL-2 gene expression was blocked at the transcriptional level by okadaic acid.
The transcription factors active at the IL-2 promoter were differentially influenced: upon down-modulation of okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases, transactivation by octamer, NF-kappa B, and NF of activated T cells proteins was abrogated, while transactivation by AP-1 proteins was even enhanced.
