Expression status of BCL-6 and syndecan-1 identifies distinct histogenetic subtypes of Hodgkin's disease.
The tumor cells in most cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD) have been recently recognized to originate from the B-cell lineage, but their precise differentiation stage is not fully clarified.
Recently, we have reported that the histogenesis of B-cell lymphomas may be assessed by monitoring the expression pattern of BCL-6, a transcription factor expressed in germinal center (GC) B cells, and CD138/syndecan-1 (syn-1), a proteoglycan associated with post-GC, terminal B-cell differentiation.
In this study, we have applied these two markers to the study of HD histogenesis.
We have found that in nodular lymphocyte predominance HD (NLPHD) tumor cells consistently display the BCL-6(+)/syn-1(-) phenotype, indicating their derivation from GC B cells.
Conversely, classic HD (CHD) is heterogeneous because the tumor cells of a fraction of CHD display the BCL-6(-)/syn-1(+) phenotype of post-GC B-cells, whereas another fraction of CHD is constituted by a mixture of tumor cells reflecting the GC (BCL-6(+)/syn-1(-)) or post-GC (BCL-6(-)/syn-1(+)) phenotypes.
BCL-6(-)/syn-1(+) tumor cells of CHD are mostly found surrounded by T cells expressing CD40L, consistent with the observation that CD40 signaling downregulates BCL-6 expression.
These data indicate that tumor cells of NLPHD uniformly display a GC B-cell phenotype, whereas the phenotype of tumor cells of CHD appears to be modulated by the surrounding cellular background, particularly CD40L+ reactive T cells.
