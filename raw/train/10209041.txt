GrpL, a Grb2-related adaptor protein, interacts with SLP-76 to regulate nuclear factor of activated T cell activation.
Propagation of signals from the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) involves a number of adaptor molecules.
SH2 domain-containing protein 76 (SLP-76) interacts with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav to activate the nuclear factor of activated cells (NF-AT), and its expression is required for normal T cell development.
We report the cloning and characterization of a novel Grb2-like adaptor molecule designated as Grb2-related protein of the lymphoid system (GrpL).
Expression of GrpL is restricted to hematopoietic tissues, and it is distinguished from Grb2 by having a proline-rich region.
GrpL can be coimmunoprecipitated with SLP-76 but not with Sos1 or Sos2 from Jurkat cell lysates.
In contrast, Grb2 can be coimmunoprecipitated with Sos1 and Sos2 but not with SLP-76.
Moreover, tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT/pp36/38 in detergent lysates prepared from anti-CD3 stimulated T cells associated with Grb2 but not GrpL.
These data reveal the presence of distinct complexes involving GrpL and Grb2 in T cells.
A functional role of the GrpL-SLP-76 complex is suggested by the ability of GrpL to act alone or in concert with SLP-76 to augment NF-AT activation in Jurkat T cells.
