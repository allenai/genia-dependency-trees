Modulation of the expression of the IFN-gamma receptor beta-chain controls responsiveness to IFN-gamma in human peripheral blood T cells.
IFN-gamma has potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in T cells that are important in determining T cell development and polarized differentiation.
Therefore, any event that enables T cells to become less responsive to IFN- gamma may potentially alter immune responsiveness to Ag.
In this work, we show that human peripheral blood T cells that are stimulated through the TCR and expanded with IL-2 are unresponsive to IFN-gamma, as determined by a lack of activation of jak kinases and the transcription factor, STAT1(alpha), a signal transducer and activator of transcription.
This nonresponsiveness occurs because of a lack of expression of the beta- chain (accessory factor) of the IFN-gamma receptor, while at the same time maintaining IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain expression.
Expression of the beta-chain can be restored by secondary TCR ligation or PMA treatment.
T cell blasts treated with PMA are now responsive to IFN-gamma.
When freshly isolated, highly enriched (>98%) T cells are examined for IFN-gamma responsiveness; these cells can respond to IFN-gamma and express beta-chain.
Therefore, as T cells progress from primary TCR activation through IL-2-dependent proliferation, followed by secondary TCR stimulation, their responsiveness to IFN-gamma varies, and this may affect their ability to participate in an ongoing immune response.
