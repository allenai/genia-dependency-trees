TRAMP, a novel apoptosis-mediating receptor with sequence homology to tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 and Fas(Apo-1/CD95).
A novel member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, designated TRAMP, has been identified.
The structural organization of the 393 amino acid long human TRAMP is most homologous to TNF receptor 1.
TRAMP is abundantly expressed on thymocytes and lymphocytes.
Its extracellular domain is composed of four cysteine-rich domains, and the cytoplasmic region contains a death domain known to signal apoptosis.
Overexpression of TRAMP leads to two major responses, NF-kappaB activation and apoptosis.
TRAMP-induced cell death is inhibited by an inhibitor of ICE-like proteases, but not by Bcl-2.
In addition, TRAMP does not appear to interact with any of the known apoptosis-inducing ligands of the TNF family.
