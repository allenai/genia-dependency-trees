Evaluation of monoclonal anti-D reagents using D variant cells.
Monoclonal anti-D antibodies submitted to the Third Monoclonal International Workshop were evaluated against a number of D variant cells using standard serological techniques.
The monoclonal antibodies were able to discriminate between the cells of Categories Va, VI and DFR but not Category III cells.
Cells within each category did not give any aberrant results.
The Rh:33 cells behaved as normal Rh(D) positive cells.
