Response to intranasal fluticasone propionate in perennial allergic rhinitis not associated with glucocorticoid receptor characteristics.
BACKGROUND: The reduction of symptoms due to treatment with corticosteroids varies among patients with perennial rhinitis.
Most patients will respond but a few patients respond less to these drugs.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association in reduction of symptoms due to glucocorticoids and glucocorticoid receptor characteristics in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, in vitro glucocorticoid receptor binding studies were performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells using dexamethasone and in vitro production of mediators were measured.
METHODS: During a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study, 200 micrograms fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (in the active treatment period) and placebo (in the placebo treatment period) were administered twice daily for 2 weeks to 22 patients allergic to house dust mite.
At the end of both treatment periods symptoms were scored after allergen provocation (100, 1000, 10000 BU/mL) and during the 9.5 hours after this challenge.
Receptor binding studies with dexamethasone were performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Leukotriene B4 produced by monocytes in vitro and soluble interleukin-2 receptor released by lymphocytes in vitro and cortisol levels in plasma were determined.
RESULTS: No significant partial correlations of the number of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell glucocorticoid receptors (6821 +/- 5669 binding sites per cell) and the affinity (Kd: 16.5 +/- 13.51 nmol/L) for the glucocorticoid receptors with the symptom score (placebo: 4.3 +/- 2.45 pts; fluticasone: 2.4 +/- 1.55 pts) after active treatment were found.
Also no significant partial correlations of the levels of leukotriene B4 (45.6 +/- 105.3 ng/10(6) cells) produced by monocytes in vitro, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (734 +/- 237 ng/10(6) cells) released by lymphocytes in vitro and cortisol levels (571 +/- 236 ng/mL) in plasma with the symptom score after active treatment were found.
CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of symptoms due to topical fluticasone propionate in patients with rhinitis and allergy to house dust mite is not correlated with the characteristics of the glucocorticoid receptor.
