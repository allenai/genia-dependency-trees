Physical and functional interaction between the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax1 protein and the CCAAT binding protein NF-Y.
Tax1, a potent activator of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) transcription, has been shown to modulate expression of many cellular genes.
Tax1 does not bind DNA directly but regulates transcription through protein-protein interactions with sequence-specific transcription factors.
Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins which interact with Tax1, we isolated the B subunit of the CCAAT binding protein NF-Y from a HeLa cDNA library.
The interaction of Tax1 with NF-YB was specific in that NF-YB did not interact with a variety of other transcription factors, including human immunodeficiency virus Tat, human papillomavirus E6, and Bicoid, or with the M7 (amino acids 29CP-AS) Tax1 mutant.
However, NF-YB did interact with the C-terminal Tax1 mutants M22 (130TL-AS) and M47 (319LL-RS).
We also show that in vitro-translated NF-YB specifically bound to a glutathione S-transferase-Tax1 fusion protein.
Further, Tax1 coimmunoprecipitated with NF-Y from nuclear extracts of HTLV-1-transformed cells, providing evidence for in vivo interaction of Tax1 and NF-YB.
We further demonstrate that Tax1 specifically activated the NF-Y-responsive DQbeta promoter, as well as a minimal promoter which contains only the Y-box element.
In addition, mutation of the Y-box element alone abrogated Tax1-mediated activation.
Taken together, these data indicate that Tax1 interacts with NF-Y through the B subunit and that this interaction results in activation of the major histocompatibility complex class II promoter.
Through activation of this and other NF-Y driven promoters, the Tax1-NF-Y interaction may play a critical role in causing cellular transformation and HTLV-1 pathogenesis.
