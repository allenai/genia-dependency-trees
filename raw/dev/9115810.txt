NF-kappa B-independent suppression of HIV expression by ascorbic acid.
Ascorbic acid (ascorbate or vitamin C) has been shown to suppress the induction of HIV in latently infected T lymphocytic cells following stimulation with a tumor promoter (PMA) and inflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha).
To assess whether this inhibition was mediated via modulation of the cellular transcription factor, NF-kappa B, we carried out gel shift analysis on nuclear extracts prepared under different conditions of cell stimulation in the presence or absence of ascorbate, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), or zidovudine (AZT).
Pretreatment of ACH-2 T cells by NAC followed by stimulation with PMA, TNF-alpha, or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) resulted in strong suppression of NF-kappa B activation.
In contrast, neither ascorbate nor AZT affected NF-kappa B activity under all three induction conditions in the ACH-2 cell line.
Ascorbate and AZT also had no effect on NF-kappa B activation following TNF-alpha- or PMA-induced stimulation of U1 promonocytic cells.
These results suggest that the molecular mechanism of HIV inhibition by ascorbate is not mediated via NF-kappa B inhibition, unlike that seen with other antioxidants.
