The proximal regulatory element of the interferon-gamma promoter mediates selective expression in T cells.
Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is produced by natural killer cells and certain subsets of T cells, but the basis for its selective expression is unknown.
Within the region between -108 and -40 base pairs of the IFN-gamma promoter are two conserved and essential regulatory elements, which confer activation-specific expression in T cells.
This report describes studies indicating that the most proximal of these two regulatory elements is an important determinant of its restricted expression.
The proximal element is a composite site that binds members of the CREB/ATF, AP-1, and octamer families of transcription factors.
Jun is essential for activation-induced transcription and binds preferably as a heterodimer with ATF-2.
In contrast, CREB appears to dampen transcription from this element.
The CpG dinucleotide in this element is selectively methylated in Th2 T cells and other cells that do not express IFN-gamma, and methylation markedly reduces transcription factor binding.
As a target for DNA methylation and for binding of transcription factors that mediate or impede transcription, this element appears to play a central role in controlling IFN-gamma expression.
