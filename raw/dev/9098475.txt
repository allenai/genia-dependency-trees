Use of new biologic markers in the ovulation induction.
Biological markers of ovulation, after a great in the past, have been fallen into disuse for the large diffusion of biochemical and biophysical ones.
However, the real effect of hormones involved in ovulation is expressed by biological modifications on target tissues.
To explore the modifications of not reproductive target tissues as ovulation markers we studied the behaviour of Albuminemia, Platelet Factor IV (as indicator of Platelet Aggregation), Type II estrogenic receptors in 42 ovulation induced women, undergoing our observation.
33 of them had ovulation and 9 developed a LUF syndrome, constituting two biological models of an opposite situation for the three markers observed.
All the markers considered were sufficiently sensitive, but among them, Platelet Factor IV was the most reliable to the hormonal ovulatory situation.
