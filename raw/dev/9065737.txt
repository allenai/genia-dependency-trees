Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated U937 cells.
During the course of serious bacterial infections, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interacts with monocyte/macrophage receptors, resulting in the generation of inflammatory cytokines.
Transcription factor NF-kappaB is crucial in activating the transcription of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines.
In this paper, we demonstrate that the activation of NF-kappaB by LPS in a promonocytic cell line (U937) followed a rather slow kinetics, depending on the rate of IkappaB-alpha inhibitor hydrolysis.
No degradation of p105 and p100 inhibitors was observed under these conditions.
The transduction pathway leading to NF-kappaB activation in U937 cells involved the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as demonstrated by the concomitant inhibitory effects of antioxidants on NF-kappaB activation and the emission of a fluorescent probe reacting intracellularly with hydrogen peroxide.
This ROS pathway was also characterized by the use of other inhibitors.
This finding indicates that phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase are also involved.
However, the NF-kappaB activation pathway involving the acidic sphingomyelinase of the endolysosomial membrane did not seem to participate in the LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in U937 cells.
