Involvement of nuclear factor-kappa B activation in IgE synthesis in human B cells.
Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) is a transcription factor that binds to the consensus DNA sequence in the cis-acting elements of various genes.
Although NF-kappa B activates the expression of many genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, little is known about the role of NF-kappa B activation in the induction of IgE synthesis in human B cells.
Therefore we first examined the participation of NF-kappa B in germline C epsilon transcription in a human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line, DND39.
Stimulation of DND39 cells with IL-4 or anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb) activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and subsequently induced nuclear expression of NF-kappa B, which was identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
n-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant, blocked NF-kappa B activation caused by IL-4 and by anti-CD40 mAb.
Although inhibition of IL-4-driven germline C epsilon transcription by NAC was not sufficient, the agent remarkably diminished anti-CD40 mAb-mediated up-regulation of germline C epsilon transcription.
Second, we studied the effect of NAC on IgE synthesis in human normal B cells costimulated with IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb.
NAC was effective in inhibiting mature C epsilon transcription and IgE synthesis in the T cell-independent culture system.
However, NAC did not significantly affect the spontaneous production of IgE by atopic B cells.
These results indicate that NF-kappa B activity is commonly inducible in DND39 cells by IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb and suggest that NF-kappa B sensitive to NAC may play a role in regulating IgE synthesis in B cells.
