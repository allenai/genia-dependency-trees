A new mouse gene, SRG3, related to the SWI3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is required for apoptosis induced by glucocorticoids in a thymoma cell line.
We isolated a new mouse gene that is highly expressed in thymocytes, testis, and brain.
This gene, SRG3, showed a significant sequence homology to SWI3, a yeast transcriptional activator, and its human homolog BAF155.
SRG3 encodes 1,100 amino acids and has 33-47% identity with SWI3 protein over three regions.
The SRG3 protein contains an acidic NH2 terminus, a myb-like DNA binding domain, a leucine-zipper motif, and a proline- and glutamine-rich region at its COOH terminus.
Rabbit antiserum raised against a COOH-terminal polypeptide of the SRG3 recognized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 155 kD.
The serum also detected a 170-kD protein that seems to be a mouse homologue of human BAF170.
Immunoprecipitation of cell extract with the antiserum against the mouse SRG3 also brought down a 195-kD protein that could be recognized by an antiserum raised against human SWI2 protein.
The results suggest that the SRG3 protein associates with a mouse SWI2.
The SRG3 protein is expressed about three times higher in thymocytes than in peripheral lymphocytes.
The expression of anti-sense RNA to SRG3 mRNA in a thymoma cell line, S49.1, reduced the expression level of the SRG3 protein, and decreased the apoptotic cell death induced by glucocorticoids.
These results suggest that the SRG3 protein is involved in the glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in the thymoma cell line.
This implicates that the SRG3 may play an important regulatory role during T cell development in thymus.
