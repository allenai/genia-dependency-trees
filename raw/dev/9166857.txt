Characterization of interleukin-10 receptor expression on B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells accumulate in vivo in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, suggesting that their malignant expansion is due, at least in part, to a delay in cell death.
However, the cellular or molecular factors responsible for a delay in B-CLL cell death are unknown.
B-CLL cells do express receptors for interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-gamma, and activation of both has been shown to promote B-CLL survival in vitro by preventing apoptosis.
The interleukin-10 (IL-10) receptor is another member of the IFN receptor family, but its ligand, IL-10, has been reported to induce apoptosis in B-CLL cells.
In the current study, we undertook a biochemical analysis of IL-10 receptor expression on freshly isolated B-CLL cells and characterized the functional responsiveness of IL-10 binding to its constitutively expressed receptor.
We show that B-CLL cells bind IL-10 with significant specificity and express between 47 and 127 IL-10 receptor sites per cell, with a dissociation constant in the range of 168 to 426 x 10(-12) mol/L.
Ligand binding and activation of the IL-10 receptor expressed on B-CLL cells results in the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT3 proteins.
This pattern of STAT protein phosphorylation is identical to IL-10 receptor activation on normal cells and similar to IFN-alpha (STAT1 and STAT3) and IFN-gamma (STAT1) receptor activation in CLL.
Further, in consecutive samples of fresh blood obtained from patients with B-CLL cells, the addition of IL-10 inhibited B-CLL proliferation, enhanced B-CLL differentiation, but did not induce apoptosis.
Indeed, IL-10, like IFN-gamma, was able to significantly reduce the amount of B-CLL cell death caused by hydrocortisone-induced apoptosis.
We conclude that cytokines, which signal through the interferon family of receptors, have comparable functional effects on B-CLL cells.
