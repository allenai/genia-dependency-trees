Expression of erythroid-specific genes in megakaryoblastic disorders.
Currently available data indicate that erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation pathways are closely related to each other, and there may exist progenitor cells common to those two lineages may exist.
Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AML-M7) and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down's syndrome (TMD) are characterized by rapid growth of abnormal blast cells which express megakaryocytic markers.
These blast cells express lineage-specific transcription factors such as GATA-1 common to these lineages and frequently express erythroid-specific mRNAs such as gamma-globin and erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS-E), indicating that most of the blasts in M7 and TMD cases have erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes.
These results suggest that blasts in M7 and TMD may correspond to progenitors of both erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.
