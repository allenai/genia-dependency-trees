Requirement of prestimulated THP-1 monocytic cells for endothelial cell activation.
Involvement of TNF alpha.
Blood monocytes spontaneously activate endothelial cells in culture, leading to adhesion of monocytic cells onto the endothelial surface and overproduction of endothelial proteins such as von Willebrand factor (vWf) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1).
To overcome the difficulty in obtaining quiescent monocytes, we studied the ability of promonocytic THP-1 cells to activate endothelial cells.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-prestimulated and untreated THP-1 cells were cocultured with resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) for 3 and 24 h in the presence of colimycin to neutralize LPS traces.
Addition of untreated THP-1 cells had little effect on HUVEC adhesiveness.
Addition of prestimulated THP-1 cells was followed by a noticeable adhesion after 3 h which reversed to basal values within 24 h.
Under these conditions HUVEC adhesion molecules, E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, were increased at 3 h with only ICAM-1 remaining overexpressed at 24 h.
Diffusible endothelial proteins such as soluble E-selectin, PAI-1 and vWf to a minimal extent, increased in supernatants from HUVEC cocultured for 24 h with prestimulated THP-1 cells.
In those cocultures, TNF alpha concentrations peaked at 3 h whereas IL-1 beta levels progressively rose until 24 h.
Addition of an anti-TNF alpha antibody decreased by 40% E-selectin and ICAM-1 induction and suppressed PAI-1 overproduction with a weak effect on vWf.
An anti-IL-1 beta antibody had negligible effects on HUVEC adhesion molecules, PAI-1 or vWf production.
These results provide evidence that promonocytic THP-1 cells require prestimulation in order to activate HUVEC and that TNF alpha contributes to this phenomenon.
