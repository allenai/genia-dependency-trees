Identification of nucleotide sequences that regulate transcription of the MCF13 murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat in activated T cells.
The region downstream of the enhancer (DEN) of the long terminal repeat of the mink cell focus-forming murine leukemia virus is important for viral pathogenicity.
Another important activity of DEN is its control of transcription in activated T cells, and we have determined that an NF-kappaB site is critical for this activity.
