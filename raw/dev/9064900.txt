[Correlation of lymphocytic infiltration of tumor tissue with the hormonal and metabolic state in patients with breast cancer]
Lymphocyte infiltration of tumor was studied vis-a-vis hormone metabolic status, tumor tissue hormone sensitivity and tobacco smoking, in 113 breast cancer patients, aged 25-77.
On the average, no correlation was established between degree of lymphocyte infiltration in breast tumor and age and menopause onset.
In smoking menopausal patients, lymphocyte infiltration was found to be higher than in non-smokers (p < 0.05).
There was a direct correlation between the rate of lymphocyte infiltration and the level of progesterone receptors in tumor.
Some subgroups displayed a direct correlation between infiltration and sex-binding globulin, cholesterol, luteinizing hormone in blood, and lean body mass.
It was matched by an inverse correlation between lymphocyte infiltration and blood-thyroid hormone concentration, urine catecholamines and free cortisol excretion and fat/lean body mass ratio.
Considering the abovesaid as well as the lymphocyte ability to perform the dual function of immunocytes and hormonocytes, it is suggested that the results may be used in both the study of lymphocyte infiltration and research in means of its control.
