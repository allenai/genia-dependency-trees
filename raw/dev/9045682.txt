Jak1 expression is required for mediating interleukin-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate and Stat6 signaling molecules.
The Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Fes tyrosine kinases have been demonstrated to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to interleukin (IL)-4 stimulation in different cell systems.
However, it is not clear which, if any, of these kinases are responsible for initiating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates in vivo.
In the present study, we have utilized a mutant Jak1-deficient HeLa cell line, E1C3, and its parental Jak1-expressing counterpart, 1D4, to analyze the role of Jak1 in mediating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events.
IL-4 treatment rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 in 1D4 but not in E1C3 cells.
IL-4-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 was pronounced in 1D4 cells, while no IL-4-induced Stat6 phosphorylation was detected in E1C3 cells.
IL-4 also induced Stat6 DNA binding activity from lysates of 1D4 but not E1C3 cells utilizing a radiolabeled immunoglobulin heavy chain germline epsilon promotor sequence (Iepsilon) in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay.
Reconstitution of Jak1 expression in E1C3 cells restored the ability of IL-4 to induce IRS and Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation.
These results provide evidence that Jak1 expression is required for mediating tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of crucial molecules involved in IL-4 signal transduction.
