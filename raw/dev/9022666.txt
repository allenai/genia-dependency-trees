Pancreatic development and maturation of the islet B cell.
Studies of pluripotent islet cultures.
Pancreas organogenesis is a highly regulated process, in which two anlage evaginate from the primitive gut.
They later fuse, and, under the influence of the surrounding mesenchyme, the mature organ develops, being mainly composed of ductal, exocrine and endocrine compartments.
Early buds are characterized by a branching morphogenesis of the ductal epithelium from which endocrine and exocrine precursor cells bud to eventually form the two other compartments.
The three compartments are thought to be of common endodermal origin; in contrast to earlier hypotheses, which suggested that the endocrine compartment was of neuroectodermal origin.
It is thus generally believed that the pancreatic endocrine-lineage possesses the ability to mature along a differentiation pathway that shares many characteristics with those of neuronal differentiation.
During recent years, studies of insulin-gene regulation and, in particular, the tissue-specific transcriptional control of insulin-gene activity have provided information on pancreas development in general.
The present review summarizes these findings, with a special focus on our own studies on pluripotent endocrine cultures of rat pancreas.
